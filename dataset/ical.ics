SUMMARY:SECCOMP your PostgreSQL
DESCRIPTION: <p>SECCOMP ("SECure COMPuting with filters") is a Linux kernel syscall filtering mechanism which allows reduction of the kernel attack surface by preventing (or at least audit logging) normally unused syscalls. Recent security best-practices recommend, and certain highly security-conscious organizations are beginning to require, that SECCOMP be used to the extent possible. The major web browsers, container runtime engines, and systemd are all examples of software that already support SECCOMP.</p><p>This talk covers SECCOMP applied to PostgreSQL via 2 different methods -- namely top-down using systemd, and at the session level using a PostgreSQL extension called pgseccomp. The two methods will be explained and compared. We will also discuss how and why the two methods might be used in conjunction. Finally, a process to determine the list of expected/legitimate PostgreSQL kernel syscalls is described.</p>

SUMMARY:Continuous Delivery starts with Continuous Infrastructure
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most organisations start their journey towards Continuous Delivery with their development teams, or often their web or mobile teams. I’ve seen many of these journeys fail because “ops” was not included in the picture.  The organisation assumed DevOps didn’t need ops. So the team didn’t adapt, didn’t provide the right stacks, couldn’t support the tools. I’ve started a number of successful journeys with the ops teams doing Continuous Delivery of their infrastructure as code. They changed their mindset, allowing them to understand, support and onboard the development teams.  This talk will document that approach with some supporting cases and examples.</p><p>Taking one step further we'll showcase a on how to do Continuous Delivery of your Infrastructure as Code,    obviously with Open Source tools</p>

SUMMARY:BSP generator for 3000+ ARM microcontrollers
DESCRIPTION: <p>For embedded developers using alternative programming languages, but also for anyone using third party driver frameworks such as libopencm3, one of the main pain points to start using a microcontroller is to make a Board Support Package.</p><p>Things like linker script or startup code (crt0) not only require skills, but also information that are not always easily accessible.</p><p>In this talk we will present a tool that generates linker script, startup code, and low level hardware binding for 3000+ ARM microcontrollers using information extracted from archives provided as part of the ARM Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).</p>

SUMMARY:STS in Ceph Object Storage
DESCRIPTION: <p>Ceph is an open source, highly scalable, software defined storage that provides object, file and block interfaces under a unified system. Ceph Object Storage Gateway (RGW) provides a RESTful object storage interface to the Ceph Storage cluster. It provides an interface that is compatible with a large subset of AWS S3 APIs.</p><p>In this talk we discuss the implementation of a subset of the APIs of AWS Secure Token Service (STS). AWS STS is a web service which enables identity federation and cross-account access by providing temporary security credentials.</p><p>Ceph Object Storage Gateway now supports some APIs of AWS STS particularly related to web identity federation and cross-account access. The advantages of these temporary credentials are that they automatically expire after a certain duration, provide limited access (via IAM policies) to resources, are provided to the user upon request, and obviate the need for users/ applications to save permanent security credentials thereby removing a potential security loophole.</p><p>As an example consider a web application that has users and needs access to RGW S3 buckets to read/ write large files. The application can delegate identity management to a trusted third party identity provider(IDP). It can get temporary credentials from STS after authenticating with the IDP and access the required RGW S3 buckets.</p>

SUMMARY:Do Linux Distributions Still Matter with Containers?
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the beginning there was compiling and static linking. My first programs when I was 10 years old worked like that. Then, we discovered dynamic linking. This was great because we could now patch one library and all of the programs would pick up the change on restart. But we created another problem - dependencies. Throughout the history of computing we have solved one problem and created another. Containers are no different. This talk will walk through why we invented Linux distros and why we should continue to appreciate them in a world full of container images...</p>

SUMMARY:Discover dependency license information with ClearlyDefined
DESCRIPTION: <p>Complying with license obligations can incur a lot of hurdles. This results in developers skipping compliance or failing to achieve correct compliance. To compound this, package authors sometimes fail to describe the license of their package clearly or omit license information of included files. ClearlyDefined is a community curated repository of discovered license information for Crates packages, among other types.</p><p>This talk will cover: the importance of the license obligations of the dependencies of your Rust package, tool, or application. How to discover the license information of those packages. And demonstrate some Cargo compatible tooling that allows automated license recordkeeping and notice file generation as a part of your CI system.</p>

SUMMARY:Introducing HPC with a Raspberry Pi cluster
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will discuss the development of a RaspberryPi cluster for teaching an introduction to HPC.</p><p>The motivation for this was to overcome four key problems faced by new HPC users:</p><ol><li>The availability of a real HPC system and the effect running training courses can have on the real system, conversely the availability of spare resources on the real system can cause problems for the training course.</li><li>A fear of using a large and expensive HPC system for the first time and worries that doing something wrong might damage the system.</li><li>That HPC systems are very abstract systems sitting in data centres that users never see, it is difficult for them to understand exactly what it is they are using.</li><li>That new users fail to understand resource limitations, in part because of the vast resources in modern HPC systems a lot of mistakes can be made before running out of resources. A more resource constrained system makes it easier to understand this.</li></ol><p>The talk will also discuss some of the technical challenges in deploying an HPC environment to a Raspberry Pi and attempts to keep that environment as close to a "real" HPC as possible. The issue to trying to automate the installation process will also be covered.</p>

SUMMARY:Applying Open Culture Practices across Distributed Teams
DESCRIPTION: <p>Distributed teams are where people you work with aren’t physically co-located, ie. they’re at another office building, home or an outsourced company abroad. They’re becoming increasingly popular, for DevOps and other teams, due to recruitment, diversity, flexibility and cost savings. Challenges arise due to timezones, language barriers, cultures and ways of working. People actively participating in Open Source communities tend to be effective in distributed teams. This session looks at how to apply core Open Source principles to distributed teams in Enterprise organisations, and the importance of shared purposes/goals, (mis)communication, leading vs managing teams, sharing and learning. We'll also look at practical aspects of what's worked well for others, such as alternatives to daily standups, promoting video conferencing, time management and virtual coffee breaks. This session is relevant for those leading or working in distributed teams, wanting to know how to cultivate an inclusive culture of increased trust and collaboration that leads to increased productivity and performance. All are welcome to attend.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Docker and Kubernetes are changing the way to deploy services and applications in the Linux world.What about FreeBSD?2 years ago we presented pot, another jail abstraction framework. In time, the pot framework has developed to provide features containers-alike.The plugin interface provided by nomad (a container orchestrator), allowed us to develop a driver for pot, enabling nomad to orchestrate pot jails.In this talk, we'd like to present this FreeBSD-based ambitious alternative to Docker-Kubernetes</p>

SUMMARY:Identity Box
DESCRIPTION: <p>Society is becoming increasingly more aware of the importance of protecting digital information and it is becoming clear that the current centralized model has came to an end.The future of the Internet is distributed. Unsupervised, unmoderated access, affordable storage, data-replication, and security and privacy built-in are the most important aspects of the Internet of the future.</p><p>Unfortunately, a global, reliable, decentralized network cannot be built without actual physical nodes, as the opposite of thousands of nodes in centralized cloud data center. Only by building an open network of physical nodes we can pave our way as a society to the decentralized Internet of the future.</p><p>Identity Box is a personal P2P networking device giving you access to a global network of distributed storage, digital identity, and distributed personal apps. It is a community effort ofbuilding the next-generation, decentralized infrastructure that enables an open platform for privacy-preserving ecosystems.</p>

SUMMARY:STAC: Search and discovery of geospatial assets
DESCRIPTION: <p>The talk introduces STAC, the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification. It aims to enable a cloud-native geospatial future by providing a common layer of metadata for better search and discovery. It is an emerging open standard to catalog and expose geospatial data from different sources either in a static or dynamic way.</p><p>We’ll cover the core set of metadata fields for STAC Catalogs, Collections, and Items first, along with available extensions for describing different types of data (EO, SAR, Point Cloud, etc.). With the basics of STAC in hand, the talk will go through the Open Source ecosystem for working with STAC metadata: validators, graphical user interfaces and client command line tools and libraries for search, access, and exploitation.</p>

SUMMARY:Building an open source data lake at scale in the cloud
DESCRIPTION: <p>This presentation will give an overview of the various tools, software, patterns and approaches that Expedia Group uses to operate a number of large scale data lakes in the cloud and on premise. The data journey undertaken by theExpedia Group is probably similar to many others who have been operating in this space over the past two decades - scaling out from relational databases to on premise Hadoop clusters to a much wider ecosystem in the cloud. This talkwill give an overview of that journey and then describe the various open source components that Expedia Group have used and built to create multi-petabyte data lakes. These include existing open source projects like Hive, Hadoop, Terraform,Docker, Kubernetes as well as open source tools that we built to overcome some of the unexpected challenges we faced. The first of these is Circus Train — a dataset replication tool that copies Hive tables between clusters and clouds. We will also discuss various other options for dataset replication and what unique features Circus Train has. The second tool is Waggle Dance — a federated Hive metadata service that enables querying of data stored across multiple Hive metastores. We will then look at Apiary - a means to simplify the deployment of the various components of an open source data lake at scale including the Hive metastore, Waggle Dance, S3 bucket access, metadata change notifications and much more. We focus on actual problems and solutions that have arisen in a huge, organically grown corporation, rather than idealised architectures.</p>

SUMMARY:Surfing the Tsunami - News from the IntelliJ IDEA Community
DESCRIPTION: <p>With releases of Java coming thick and fast every 6 months, it's a full time job staying on top of the features. If your IDE can help you here, it's one less thing to worry about.  IntelliJ IDEA Community had three releases this year, each on improved the support for modern versions of Java, but that's not the only thing on offer.</p><p>Join this session to see what's new in IntelliJ IDEA Community (the free one!). This is not limited to just supporting new language features, which some of us might not get to use for ages, but better support for things developers do every day, and improved performance and stability, because an all-singing, all-dancing IDE is all well and good, but if it's not usable those features mean nothing.</p>

SUMMARY:NFS Ganesha
DESCRIPTION: <p>NFS-Ganesha is an extensible user-space NFS server that supports NFS v3, v4, v4.1, v4.2, pNFS, and 9P protocol. It has an easily pluggable architecture called FSAL (File System Abstraction Layer), which enables seamless integration with many filesystem backends (GlusterFS, Ceph, etc.). There will be a discussion on the components along with an architectural explanation of NFS Ganesha with a detailed look at how a request flows through the various layers of NFS Ganesha and see some critical aspects in using NFS Ganesha. Along with the discussion on "your first contribution to NFS Ganesha" the audience will be engaged in a collaborative session and with a live demo, take a detailed look at the Clustered HA implementation using pacemaker/corosync with a specific example of a distributed storage, GlusterFS.</p><p>Finally, there will be an open dialogue about the inclusion of Transport Layer Security into NFS Ganesha. One major drawback seen with NFS is the lack of transmitting encrypted data packets to and from NFS Server and Client. This lack is widely frowned upon, and it seems like there is enough communication gap within the community about its development, which I hope to shorten and revive the chatter to begin progress in this course.</p>

It is a requirement, not an option, if the Internet is going to scale.  Multicast allows application developers to add more functionality without significantly impacting the network."</p><p>Nearly two decades later, multicast is still largely ignored and misunderstood.</p><p>This talk explains why multicast is the missing piece in the decentralization puzzle, how multicast can help the Internet continue to scale, better protect our privacy, solve IOT problems and make polar bears happier at the same time.</p>

SUMMARY:Making an IoT robot
DESCRIPTION: <p>Technical barrier to target low cost micro controllers can be too high for many developers already used to high level API. But did you know that those devices can support many operating systems like NuttX inspired by POSIX (same for Linux), but it goes even behind than C APIs, even JavaScript runtimes like IoT.js can be supported too. IoT.js can also support JS community modules such as Generic-sensor-lite to support sensors and actuators or webthing-iotjs to enable REST API for embedded applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Is the Open door closing?
DESCRIPTION: <p>"Open Source" has been wildly successful, no doubt.</p><p>Yet, in recent years, we have seen a massive amount of failed 'open' projects.</p><p>Why is that?</p><p>I have identified 10+ scenarios in which the 'Open' approach works. But what is most interesting, is that those scenarios have enabling conditions, and while those conditions are taken for granted, they are not.</p><p>Not every 'Open' project is sustainable. Not every project is worth adopting or contributing to.</p><p>During the presentation, we will look into what works and why, and what to expect from different 'Open' initiatives. We will cover almost everything that can be open - starting from hardware, through software, education, and we will end up covering Open Governments.</p><p>Each sector is different, and for some of them, the 'Open' approach will not work. Come and see what I have found out in this space during my research, and evaluate whether you are working on the right project.</p><p>Because the only resource you will never get back is time.</p>

SUMMARY:dqlite: High-availability SQLite
DESCRIPTION: <p>SQLite has proven extremely successful at providing applications with a powerful, portable and embeddable SQL engine that can handle most of their data storage needs.</p><p>Unfortunately, SQLite is neither replicating nor fault tolerant. These two features are however very important for the rising Edge/IoT market: dqlite delivers both of them.</p><p>dqlite is a C library which exposes a SQLite database over the network and replicates it using the Raft algorithm, with built-in automatic failover.</p><p>It allows to build and operate a fault-tolerant cluster of nodes each running an instance of the user application.</p><p>dqlite was created to support clustering in the LXD container management project, where it has been used for over a year. In this talk we will look at its design, implementation and various use cases.</p>

SUMMARY:M³: Taking Microkernels to the Next Level
DESCRIPTION: <p>Current microkernels have shown to provide advantages in terms of security, robustness, and flexibility of systems. However, in recent years, the hardware added new challenges that need to be addressed as well, demanding approaches that include the hardware into the picture. First, hardware is getting more and more heterogeneous and consists not only of general-purpose cores, but contains also various accelerators. Second, system designers need to integrate untrusted third-party components (e.g., accelerators or modems) to meet today's performance, energy, and development-time demands. And third, security vulnerabilities such as Meltdown, Spectre, and Fallout have shown that today's complex general-purpose cores should not be trusted anymore to properly enforce isolation boundaries between different software components.</p><p>In my talk, I will present a new system architecture that takes existing microkernel ideas to the "next level" to address the mentioned challenges. We use a hardware/operating system co-design consisting of a small and simple hardware component, called <em>trusted communication unit</em> (TCU), that we add next to each processing element (core, accelerator, modem, etc.) and an operating system, called <em>M³</em>, that takes advantage of it. The TCU provides a uniform interface for all processing elements, simplifying the management and usage of heterogeneous processing elements, and enables secure communication between arbitrary processing elements. M³ is designed as a microkernel-based system and runs its components on different processing elements with TCU-based communication channels between them. To account for the security vulnerabilities in today's cores, M³ places components onto different and physically isolated processing elements by default, but allows sharing of processing elements as a fallback.</p>

SUMMARY:Linphone Instant Messaging Encryption
DESCRIPTION: <p>For many years, Linphone has been one of the most active free communication software. Originally focused on voice, aditionnal functionalities were rapidly added like video, group chat and presence. All of these communication modes imply privacy.</p><p>To achieve a good level of privacy, users must be able to ensure that their communications can only be displayed to the receiver of those communications, especially no-one from server infrastructure crossed by the messages shall be in the position of compromising secrecy of the communication. Basically, this is what end-to-end encryption is aiming to achieve.</p><p>Linphone does implement end-to-end encryption for voice and video communications thanks to ZRTP (rfc 6189). However, for messaging, security was only performed using point-to-point cyphering, based on SIP TLS. To bring users of instant messaging features the same level of security, we decided to implement end-to-end encryption mechanisms for messaging too, including group chat.  Linphone Instant Messaging Encryption follows state-of-the-art methods for forward secrecy and MitM detection.</p><p>This discussion will focus on protocols' extension to existing SIP standards, implementation challenges and future extensions.</p>

SUMMARY:Landscape of new challenges in modern virtualization platforms
DESCRIPTION: <p>Because virtualization is everywhere, new challenges in the IT world are revealing that this crucial component has to be improved on a regular basis. This requires a lot of coordination between Open Source projects as well as intense research and development efforts.</p><p>NVMe storage performance revealing hidden bottlenecks, Intel CPU flaws changing the security landscape regarding isolation, increasing complexity of stacks requiring more and more components working together, hardware specialization, new protocols, new use cases on top (k8s): these are a few of the challenges that a virtualization platform must answer in 2020.</p><p>We'll first see a landscape of these new challenges, then the possible approaches to solve them, and finally a concrete example of what the XCP-ng project is doing to integrate all these changes in a fully Open Source fashion, inside a turnkey Xen distro.</p>

SUMMARY:RFC 1984
DESCRIPTION: <p>In 1996 Brian E. Carpenter of IAB and Fred Baker of IETF wrote a co-statement on cryptographic technology and the internet.  This RFC wasn't a request for a technical standard, it was a statement on their concerns about Governments trying to restrict or interfere with cryptography. They felt that there was a need to offer "All Internet Users an adequate degree of privacy"</p><p>Since that time successive governments around the world have sought to build back doors into encrypted apps and services to access more citizen and visitor data.  As of July 2019, the AG of the United States William Barr stated: “Some argue that, to achieve at best a slight incremental improvement in security, it is worth imposing a massive cost on society in the form of degraded safety,” i.e For security Americans should accept weakened encryption.  The head of the FBI also claimed that weakened encryption wouldn't break it.  At the moment the US Government is actively trying to stop Facebook implementing end to end encryption across it's suite of apps.</p><p>In Australia the metadata retention laws have been abused against journalists with 58 searches carried out by the AFP.  In 2015 ACT police carried out 115 metadata searches.  UK officials have a cavalier attitude to the EU SIS database which tracks undocumented migrants, missing people, stolen cars, or suspected criminals.</p><p>The EU isn't immune to this either with France considering implementing Facial Recognition on its government services.</p><p>IETF Session 105 mentioned privacy and concerns with the mass collection of data. While the IAB and IESG were worried about US export controls on cryptography there is an argument for RFC 1984 to be updated to include the unnecessary mass collection of data and to use it as a term for IT professionals, privacy advocates and the public to rally behind.</p><p>In this talk let's recount a brief history of governments around the world wanting to weaken encryption as RFC 1984 warned us about.</p><p>We live in a time where citizens put data into commercial, healthcare and Government systems to access services, some services are only accessible online. From CCTV to Facebook people have little understanding of why mass collection of data is dangerous. There is little scrutiny of who can access that data, from Scotland to the US.</p><p>Open Surveillance is only a small part of the picture when profiling citizens.  It still counts as personal data, when combined with metadata and the actual data that people put into social media and services like ancestor DNA test kits.  Businesses who use CCTV have to put up signs to warn the public they are recording.  So called anonymized data still contains identifiers that can tie to individuals.</p><p>Let's talk about Ovid and peacocks. Let's explore how to expand the RFC to cover recent developments in surveillance capitalism with governments accessing that data, but not securing it. We need to make it clear weakened encryption, the mass collection and careless retention of data isn't acceptable. RFC1984 became Best Practice in 2015, we need to do more to raise awareness and to implement it in our projects.</p>

SUMMARY:Magic Castle: Terraforming the Cloud for HPC
DESCRIPTION: <p>Compute Canada provides HPC infrastructures and support to every academic research institution in Canada. In recent years, Compute Canada has started distributing research software to its HPC clusters using with CERN software distribution service, CVMFS. This opened the possibility for accessing the software from almost any location and therefore allow the replication of the Compute Canada experience outside of its physical infrastructure.</p><p>From these new possibilities emerged an open-source software project named Magic Castle, which aims to recreate the Compute Canada user experience in public clouds. Magic Castle uses the open-source software Terraform and HashiCorp Language (HCL) to define the virtual machines, volumes, and networks that are required to replicate a virtual HPC infrastructure. The infrastructure definition is packaged as a Terraform module that users can customize as they require. Once their cluster is deployed, the user is provided with a complete HPC cluster software environment including a Slurm scheduler, a Globus Endpoint, JupyterHub, LDAP, DNS, and over 3000 research software compiled by experts with EasyBuild. Magic Castle is compatible with AWS, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, OpenStack, and OVH.</p><p>Compute Canada staff has been using this software to deploy ephemeral clusters for training purposes every other week for the past two years. Magic Castle is also gaining in popularity with HPC cluster users for development, testing, and continuous integration.</p><p>In this talk, we will give a live demonstration of the creation of a cluster. We will present the architecture of Magic Castle, explain infrastructure and provisioning design, and present use cases. We will conclude by describing some of the challenges experienced while developing this novel usage of Terraform.</p>

SUMMARY:How FOSS could revolutionize municipal government
DESCRIPTION: <p>Free and Open Source software has revolutionized the Software Industry and nearly all other areas of human endeavor, but until now its reach into actual governance at the municipal citizen level has not been very deep. Initiatives like Code for America have encountered challenges driving acceptance for FOSS alternatives to proprietary software for citizen governance. At the same time the gap between citizen need and cities’ capabilities as widened. But several new projects are aiming to change this state of affairs to help empower citizens and improve municipal services worldwide through adoption of FOSS. Learn about these efforts and how you can get involved.</p>

SUMMARY:Low-end platform profiling with HawkTracer profiler
DESCRIPTION: <p>HawkTracer is low-overhead instrumentation-based profiler built at Amazon Video for platforms with limited capabilities. It's written in C but can be used almost with any other language (we've successfully used it with JavaScript, LUA, Python and Rust). It's highly extensible (at compile time) and portable so it can be run on almost any embedded device. In this talk I'll introduce the architecture of the profiler, present it's advantages and limitations, show how can you instrument the code and demonstrate the profiler in action by running it with an example cross-language (Rust, C++ and Python) project.</p>

SUMMARY:The next generation of contributors is not on IRC
DESCRIPTION: <p>There is some combination of a turf war and a diaspora happening in the open source communities I participate in. There are synchronous and async channels galore. Every one of them has fans and haters with firmly held opinions on how it's the best or worst thing in the world.</p><p>Let's take a step back and take a look at the landscape together. What are our communities searching for when they hop into communication channels? How do we meet new members where they are comfortable in order to be more welcoming?</p><p>As a self-defined GitHub generation of open source enthusiast, I'd like to start a conversation from my personal experience and then jump into research on the options available to us today. I hope we can leave with a view of the world spanning across channels with a focus on our contributors.</p>

SUMMARY:XL, an extensible programming language
DESCRIPTION: <p>XL is an extensible programming language, designed to grow with Moore's law instead of being killed by it.Extensible means that programmers can add features and notations much like they would add functions or classes in existing languages.The mechanisms are based on meta-programming, and are a bit similar to the macros that gave Lisp its longevity, but with interesting twists.As a proof of this extensibility, basic arithmetic (addition, multiplication, etc) or control statements (if-then-else, loops, etc) are implemented by libraries in XL, yet offer similar performance and usability as built-in features in C++.Another validation of the extensibility is Tao3D, an XL-based interactive graphic language that will be used to give the presentation.</p>

SUMMARY:AI at the edge with Tensorflow Lite to Design the Future of Vertical Farming
DESCRIPTION: <p>While Machine Learning is usually deployed in the cloud, lightweight versions of these algorithms that fit for constrained IoT systems such as microcontrollers are appearing.Using Machine Learning « at-the-edge » has indeed several advantages such as the reduction of network latency, it provides better privacy, and are working offline.In this presentation, we will demonstrate how to deploy Deep Learning algorithms on IoT devices thanks to TensorFlow Lite. We will see how to use it to design a smart vertical farming system able to predict and optimize the plant growth, at home or in developing countries where a reliable Internet connection still is missing.</p>

SUMMARY:New Java Features & Apache NetBeans
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Java platform experiences an outburst of cool new features – recently, local variable type inference, switch enhancements and multi-line string literals have been added to the Java language. Many other features are being in the pipeline and are actively worked on, like simple data carriers and pattern matching for the Java language, or  value classes for the Java virtual machine. These features are delivered quickly, thanks to the recently adopted, predictable, six-months schedule of major Java SE releases. This new release cadence means new Java platform features are delivered twice every year!</p><p>In this talk, we will show a live demo of many of the recently added and newly developed features and improvements for the Java platform, including those mentioned above. The Apache NetBeans IDE will be used to demonstrate the features.</p>

SUMMARY:Fixing healthcare data exchange with decentralized FOSS
DESCRIPTION: <p>In The Netherlands we have a interesting problem: in 2011, weeks before going live, the national electronic health record system got shut down by our senate. They decided not to interveine and let the market fix the problem. Now, 9 years later, the market has made a mess out of it: there is no uniform way of exchanging medical data in The Netherlands.Architects write countless of pages with solutions, the government pours  millions into subsidised programs, but the problem is only getting bigger.</p><p>So, 2 years ago together with a group of other software vendors we started a foundation called Nuts. The goal is to end this impasse by building an open source decentralised infrastructure that nobody controls and can be used by everyone. It should be cheap to join, privacy by design, and use technology over lawyers.</p><p>Our infrastructure allows parties to exchange data "peer to peer", only helping them solve four generic problems: user identity, patient consent, discovery of endpoints and logging.</p><p>In this talk I would like to show our architecture, explain which choices we made, what we have learned while working with a distributed software and some anecdotes about what happens if you pitch such an idea to the establishment.</p><hr /><p>A little more background: I'm one of the main devs. The system is written mostly in Go and some parts in Java. Every software vendor can spin up a node and join the network. Patient Consents are distributed by a DLT (Corda) and are only stored on the nodes of vendors who already process the patient`s data. No medical data flows through the system, Nuts is only used to connect them and provide a level of trust. Identities are managed by a self-sovereign Identity system called IRMA (irma.app) which is based on IBM idemix.</p>

SUMMARY:Debugging with LLVM
DESCRIPTION: <p>The aim of this presentation is to showcase the technologies available in LLVM that aid debugging. We will focus on LLDB, the debugger, and sanitisers (e.g. AddressSanitizer and LeakSanitizer). No prior knowledge is required, but if you're familiar with GDB or Valgrind then this talk will introduce you to alternatives available within LLVM.</p><p>LLDB is a very powerful and extensible command line debugger available on Linux, Mac OS, FreeBSD, Windows and Android. It is used internally in XCode and Android Studio and available on various hardware platforms (e.g. X86, ARM, AArch64, PowerPC, Mips). LLDB is built as a set of reusable components which highly leverage existing libraries in LLVM. It has a very powerful expression evaluation engine, intuitive CL interface (with tab-completion), easy to navigate help pages and a "graphical" user interface. In this presentation we will explore basic usage as well as some lesser known features. LLDB has come a long way and we want to present how intuitive, helpful and powerful it can be when used pragmatically.</p><p>While LLDB will let you easily examine and debug a program at the point of failure, it can be harder to diagnose the underlying problem if it occurred before the program crashed or printed an incorrect result. LLVM provides some extra features in the form of 'sanitizers' to help find the root cause of some extra problems, like accessing a wrong-but-still-valid memory address or unintentionally wrapping a signed integer value. This presentation will explore how to use the sanitizers to debug programs and some examples of bugs they can catch.</p>

SUMMARY:Sphactor: actor model concurrency for creatives
DESCRIPTION: <p>We propose a combined visual and text-based programming environment based on the actor model suitable for novice to expert programmers. This model encompasses simple communicating entities which easily scale from utilizing threads inside the computer to massive distributed computer systems. Our proposal is very suitable for IOT scenarios, creative coding practices and rapid prototyping. The prototype utilizes zeromq transports and embeds python for easy creation of actors.</p>

SUMMARY:Fundamental Technologies We Need to Work on for Cloud-Native Networking
DESCRIPTION: <p>Many people and companies are betting that cloud-native networkingwill be the preferred way of implementing network functions in an easyand scalable way. It is based around the tenants of modularity, highavailability, scalability, low-overhead networking, and ease ofdeployment. And a number of companies such as Google has shown that itis really possible to achieve these properties with it. But thearchitectural basis of cloud-native is quite different from the onesof virtualization-based NFV, but nevertheless, in many cases wecontinue to use the software packages that were designed for thatdrastically different architecture. The question is, how well doesthe current set of open source projects used in NFV work in acloud-native environment and what needs to change in them in order torealize the cloud-native vision?</p><p>In this presentation, I will define what I mean with cloud-nativenetworking and from that derive the system requirements needed to realizethat vision. Based on these requirements, we can deduce a number ofbasic architectural properties, features and services that are neededin the system to be able to satisfy these requirements. Then I will gothrough the most popular open source projects such as Linux, DPDK andOVS and see how they satisfy these architectural properties andfeatures. The main contribution of this presentation will be to showwhat we need to work on within these SW packages in order to realizecloud-native networking. Or maybe we need completely new SW projectsto be able to achieve this.</p>

SUMMARY:Idiomatic Kotlin Microservices
DESCRIPTION: <p>Although Kotlin is, from a language perspective, 100% interoperable with Java, due to the slight paradigm shift (nullability) there might be some pain when using Java frameworks, e.g.: the need of <code>private var lateinit</code> when using JUnit, having to use compiler plugins to open up Spring annotated beans or a generated zero-arg constructor for Hibernate.This talk goes through a full fledged alternative to the common Java stack when writing microservices, using: Ktor (Web framework), Kodein (DI container), Exposed (SQL library), Spek (test framework), Gradle Kotlin DSL, ...</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Maggy is an open-source framework built on Apache Spark, for asynchronous parallel execution of trials for machine learning experiments. In this talk, we will present our work to tackle search as a general purpose method efficiently with Maggy, focusing on hyperparameter optimization. We show that an asynchronous system enables state-of-the-art optimization algorithms and allows extensive early stopping in order to increase the number of trials that can be performed in a given period of time on a fixed amount of resources.</p>

SUMMARY:How lowRISC made its Ibex RISC-V CPU core faster
DESCRIPTION: <p>Ibex implements RISC-V 32-bit I/E MC M-Mode, U-Mode and PMP. It uses an in order 2 stage pipe and is best suited for area and power sensitive rather than high performance applications. However there is scope for meaningful performance gains without major impact to power or area. This talk describes work done at lowRISC to analyse and improve the performance of Ibex. The RTL of an Ibex system is simulated using Verilator to run CoreMark and Embench and the traces analysed to identify the major sources of stalls within them. This informs where improvements should be targeted. The open source implementation tools Yosys and openSTA are used to assess potential timing and area impacts of these improvements. In this talk you’ll learn about the pipeline of Ibex, methods to analyse the performance of CPU microarchitecture and how to use Yosys and openSTA to analyse what limits clock frequency in a design.</p>

SUMMARY:Jaegertracing in Ceph
DESCRIPTION: <p>Jaeger and Opentracing provide ready to use tracing services for distributed systems and are becoming widely used de-facto standard because of their ease of use. Making use of these libraries, Ceph, can reach to a much-improved monitoring state, supporting visibility to its background distributed processes. This would, in turn, add up to the way Ceph is being debugged, “making Ceph more transparent” in identifying abnormalities.In this session, the audience will get to learn about using distributed tracing in large scale distributed systems like Ceph, an overview of Jaegertracing in Ceph and how someone can use it for debugging Ceph.</p>

SUMMARY:Forth - The New Synthesis
DESCRIPTION: <p>The "new synthesis" of Forth is an ongoing effort in spirit of the Forth Modification Laboratory workshops. Its aim is to identify the essentials of Forth and to combine them in a new way to build systems that can scale-down as Forth always didand can scale-up to large applications and development projects.</p><p>The new synthesis is guided by the two principles biological analogy and disaggregation.</p><p>We scrutinize many aspects of traditional and modern Forth implementations trying to separate techniques that are normally deeply intertwined. After isolating the techniques we thrive to combine them in new ways.</p><p>The talk describes two mile stones of the ongoing project:</p><ul><li><p>preForth (&lt; 500 LOCs) a minimalistic non-interactive Forth kernel that can bootstrap itself and can be used as an easy-to-port basis for a full Forth implementation or implementing other programming languages. It is an open ended language that inherits functionality from the target platform's development tools.</p></li><li><p>seedForth (&lt;550 LOCs) a minimal stack based extensible programming system accepting tokenized source code. seedForth can be extended in various ways: as stand alone applications, as fully interactive systems, as umbilical target system for embedded system's programming</p></li></ul><p>We try to use Forth wherever possible in order to minimize semantic and formalism mismatches. Everything should be readily available - no hidden secrets.</p><p>Of course many of the subjects we are looking at have been used by others in the Forth community and outside - we are dwarfs standing on the shoulders of giants - however we believe our new synthesis to be original.</p>

SUMMARY:Public clouds and vulnerable CPUs: are we secure?
DESCRIPTION: <p>A whole bunch of CPU vulnerabilities were revealed in the past few years:Meltdown and Spectre, SSB, L1TF and MDS -- and there's little hope that we'veseen them all. Every time there is a new vulnerability released, big cloudprovides on day 1 claim that their hosts were updated and that their usersare secure. Is this so or do we also need to do something inside our Linuxguests to mitigate these vulnerabilities? And, do we have the required toolsto actually do the mitigations? Are all of them enabled by default or not? And,if not, why? In the talk I'll try to answer these questions.</p>

SUMMARY:What are we talking about when we say "open design"?
DESCRIPTION: <p>As designers working with Libre/Open Source software, we have a strong opinion on how tools shape practice. And as designers, in general, we care deeply about our methods, workflows, principles and licenses. For some time now we've been debating the issue of terminology: how we describe our practice to others and how free/libre software terms and ideas can be integrated into design methods.</p><p>In this talk, we want to propose an exercise in labeling. Building up from conversations we had with other designers moving in the sphere of Libre Software and Libre Culture, we want to:- present terms and try to define their scope in the hopes of improving the ways in which open design can be explained to others- distinguish between possible stances inside the sphere of open design, such as using libre tools vs. proprietary toolchains, designing for free software vs. designing with free software- explore how we understand other designers/studios/communities' ideas and practices- better understand how we can present our views and work vis-à-vis other design approaches -- especially to "traditional" and proprietary-oriented audiences</p><p>This talk is a follow-up to "Open Design, Libre Graphics: Why terminology matters", that we presented at Libre Graphics Meeting 2019. This was the starting point of a discussion we feel the need to bring to the table, along with other designers that share the love for F/LOSS.</p>

SUMMARY:GDB pipelines -- convenience iteration over inferior data structures
DESCRIPTION: <p>We introduce a GDB plugin for working with large data structures in the inferior.</p><p>This plugin brings some of the flexibility of Unix pipelines to the GDB command prompt, providing the ability to <em>conveniently</em> run some action on every element in a data structure that matches certain criteria.</p><p>One big aim of this plugin is to make it easy and convenient for a user to write their own sub-commands to iterate over the data structures used in their own program.</p><p>This is intended for anyone who has found difficulty inspecting large data structures from inside GDB.</p>

SUMMARY:Run ZFS in userspace
DESCRIPTION: <p>While running in user space ZFS utilizes a user space binary called ztest.In cStor, we followed a similar approach to create a binary called ‘zrepl’ that is part of cStor. It has been built using the libraries similar to what is used for ztest and contains transactional, pooled storage layers.cStor uses ZFS behind the scenes by running it in the user space. This talk we will discuss in detail how we used ZFS in userspace for storage engine cStor and highlight a few challenges that our team faced while building this data engine.</p>

SUMMARY:The Ethics of Open Source
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open Source was supposed to level the playing field for creating and consuming software by reducing the monopolistic power of companies building proprietary software. But we didn't get the kind of democratized gift economy we were expecting. Instead, we are seeing open source creating opportunities and incentives for the already privileged to create new, and exacerbate existing, injustices. To the extent that we want to use software to create a just world, we should reject the Open Source ideology, and start thinking seriously about what comes next.</p>

SUMMARY:A minimal pur object-oriented reflective language
DESCRIPTION: <p>Pharo is a minimalist reflective dynamically typed object-oriented language. Pharo is inspired from Smalltalk: Its full syntax fits on a postcard.Its model is simple: everything is an object instance of a class, methods are all public virtual, attributes are first class objects and are protected. There is single inheritance andtraits. And nothing else! (see <a href="http://mooc.pharo.org">http://mooc.pharo.org</a>). Still Pharo is a real language that is started to be used in industry <a href="http://pharo.org/success">http://pharo.org/success</a> and <a href="http://consortium.pharo.org">http://consortium.pharo.org</a>. The entire Pharo stack is MIT.Pharo reflective core is bootstrapped from source code.  Experiences shows that we can have down to 11k (adding 2 smallint) and that a simple web app can betrim down to 500 kb.</p>

SUMMARY:Getting inspired by open software for a web site: g3n.fyi
DESCRIPTION: <p>So you are here at FOSDEM in Brussels. Also sightseeing? Geocaching? Tried to optimize your way along the sights or to find many caches without making it a hike? Then you've got the traveling salesman problem! Famous in computer science because finding the optimum is extremely difficult and finding good approximations can be done easily.</p><p>Last year we had a talk about 3geonames.org where the Hilbert curve was mentioned to be used in name generation. When researching about this space curve it turned out that such space filling curves give good approximations for the traveling salesman problem. This has already been evaluated scientifically. Route finding using thees curves is extremely simple. Other algorithms need much more computational effort. Using a space filling curve to find a route proposal and improving it with 2-Opt optimization algorithm gives the quality of 2-Opt at high speed. Even so fast that it keeps track with interactive changes of the waypoints on a moving map display.</p><p>This mechanism gives short routes for your sightseeing or geocaching planning and can also be used professionally if you have to visit several locations on a single tour as in package delivery, meals on wheels, or elderly care.</p>

SUMMARY:The Selfish Contributor Explained
DESCRIPTION: <p>It has become very popular in the last several years to think of free and open source as a community forward activity, indeed the modern approach is to try and form a community or foundation first and do code second.  There is also much talk about maintainer burn out and community exploitation.  However, the same people who talk about this still paraphrase the most famous quote from the Cathedral and the Bazaar "Scratching your own itch".  They forget this is your own itch not everyone else's because Open Source begins as a selfish activity.  The fact that communities do form around a load of selfish competing individuals is actually a testament to the unacknowledged power of open source to co-opt the selfish instinct and make it synergistic to some communal good.</p><p>This talk will explore the selfish origins of free and open source and dissect the co-option power it has to form broad and deep communities from what are apparently simple transactional engagements.  We'll also explain how some of the more recent community failures have been engendered by the concentration on long term community to the detriment of enabling purely transactional mechanics by which initially selfish contributors come to the project.</p>

Sharing files with the guest is required by several use cases including container VMs, File-System-as-a-Service, and traditional virtualization.  virtio-fs goes further than previous attempts by taking advantage of the co-location of the guest and host using DAX to share the host page cache.  This presentation explains how to use virtio-fs, a bit about how it works internally, and the current status.</p>

Do you have to believe in or be a supporter of socialism, capitalism, or liberalism? Do we, when we work for software freedom, have to agree on certain positions on privacy, intelligence services, the military, the climate catastrophe, nuclear power, vaccinations, or animal rights?</p><p>Or should we accept to have different views or even allow each other not to discuss certain views, because what brings us together are other values?</p>

SUMMARY:DEBATE: Should FOSS licenses be enforced at all?
DESCRIPTION: <p>In a perfect world, lawyers (and the entire legal system) should not be necessary. And in a perfect FOSS world, everyone respects each and every provision of every license. The reality is, however, very different, and enforcement may be a necessary evil. This need does not mean we have to open the gates to be flooded by "copyleft trolls", but to establish a sound enforcement policy, in order to unleash the lawyers only for the most blatant and repeated violations</p>

SUMMARY:Snorkel Beambell - Real-time Weak Supervision on Apache Flink
DESCRIPTION: <p>The advent of Deep Learning models has led to a massive growth of real-world machine learning. Deep Learning allows Machine Learning Practitioners to get the state-of-the-art score on benchmarks without any hand-engineered features. These Deep Learning models rely on massive hand-labeled training datasets which is a bottleneck in developing and modifying machine learning models.</p><p>Most large scale Machine Learning systems today like Google’s DryBell use some form of Weak Supervision to construct lower quality, large scale training datasets that can be used to continuously retrain and deploy models in a real-world scenario.</p><p>The challenge with continuous retraining is that one needs to maintain prior state (e.g., the learning functions in case of Weak Supervision or a pre-trained model like BERT or Word2Vec for Transfer Learning) that is shared across multiple streams, while continuously updating the model. Apache Beam’s Stateful Stream processing capabilities are a perfect match here including support for scalable Weak Supervision.</p><p>Prior work on using Beam’s State coupled with Flink’s dynamic processing capabilities to store and update word embeddings for real-time Online Topic Modeling of text has been presented at Flink Forward Berlin 2018.  Similar streaming pipelines would also work for real-time model updates using Weak Supervision and Transfer Learning. In this talk, we’ll be looking at a framework - Snorkel BeamBell - a framework leveraging Stanford’s Snorkel library for Weak Supervision and Apache Beam for large scale Weak Supervision Learning for online labeling of large amounts of data that can continuously learn new classification models based on Stateful Learning Functions and user feedback.</p>

SUMMARY:A Rose by Any Other Name Would Run Just as Long
DESCRIPTION: <p>Abstract: Radio based communication systems and imagers operate under real-time constraints. Off-loading computes to an FPGA seems like a solution to speeding-up your application but comes with many pitfalls.  Specifically, software-oriented implementations fail to achieve the required interface bandwidths or computational throughput required to see a speed-up.  In this talk, we will discuss the organization of common compute motif's in software-defined-radio and their complexity in time and resources for FPGAs.</p>

SUMMARY:Challenges and opportunities in scientific software development
DESCRIPTION: <p>The approaches used in software development in an industry setting and a scientific environment are exhibit a number of fundamental differences. In the former industry setting modern team development tools and methods are used (version control, continuous integration, Scrum, ...) to develop software in teams with a focus on the final software product. In contrast, in the latter scientific environment a large fraction of scientific code is produced by individual scientists lacking thorough training in software development with a specific research goal in mind. Indeed, it is only in the last decades that scientific software development started to become a fully recognized part of scientific work. Still, formal training in software development is largely missing in the scientific curricula of many universities. Additionally, due to the exploratory nature of the scientific method at the frontier of knowledge, most projects require the implementation of custom code. The combination of these circumstances promotes the development of scientific code not suited for sharing and long term maintenance, limiting the reusability and reproducibility of scientific data and findings. The systematic development and adoption of open source packages by the scientific community can emend this situation. Here we present examplary open source packages from the field of neuroscience and discuss the special requirements for open source software development and services in this research area.</p><p>Acknowledgements:This project has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under Specific Grant Agreement No. 785907 (Human Brain Project SGA2).

SUMMARY:Using OpenAPI to Maximise Your Pulp 3 Experience
DESCRIPTION: <p>Pulp (https://pulpproject.org) enables users to organize and distribute software. Now that Pulp 3.0 is generally available, it’s time to integrate it into your software delivery workflows. While the REST API is the primary integration point, it is the OpenAPI schema definition of that API that enables users to build client libraries in various languages. These clients simplify the integration with Pulp 3.</p><p>This talk will provide a brief introduction to OpenAPI. This will be followed by a demonstration of how to use the Pulp’s OpenAPI schema to generate a Python client for Pulp’s REST API. The Python client will then be used to perform various workflows in Pulp 3.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Sharing knowledge in a team of people working together (company, association, study group or any other kind of project) is key for its long-term success. Even if this is not properly identified from the beginning as a main concern, setting up tools and processes that allow knowledge to be accumulated and organized correctly ends up being on the TODO list at some point, and may come with the wish to have done it earlier. Thus, the best solution is one that is quick enough to setup from the very beginning and versatile enough to be able to incrementally develop into a proper solid fortress of knowledge.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Where, oh where, is all that time going? What in the world is that database thing doing?! This talk will help you understand what's happening (and why) and how to analyze poor query performance. We'll also go over steps and strategies to take to improve them and get the performance (and scalability!) you need.</p><p>It all starts with figuring out what queries are slow, we'll do that by going into the various PostgreSQL configuration options for logging queries and a few helpful modules for getting even more information about ongoing queries. Next we'll go over EXPLAIN and EXPLAIN ANALYZE output for select queries, what the EXPLAIN output means in terms of how the query is being executed. Lastly (this is the good part- you have to stay til the end to get it!) we'll go over ways to improve the queries, including index creation, rewriting the query to allow PG to use a different plan, and how to tune parameters for specific queries.</p>

SUMMARY:Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) Basics
DESCRIPTION: <p>Introducing Relax-and-Recover (ReaR) for the novice users. What is it and what can it mean for you? Is Disaster Recovery useful to consider it or not? How can ReaR assist you with DR?ReaR can store the details about your systems on disks (NAS, USB, SAN,...) or network (PXE, NFS, CIFS,...) including the complete backup. It also creates a bootable image which you need to recreate your system from scratch.Furthermore, thanks to the modular concept, ReaR integrates perfectly with external backup solutions (be commercial and/or open source ones) to do the backup and restore part which makes ReaR very scalable in big enterprises. ReaR scales even with Cloud solutions and is the heart of another great project (DRLM or Disaster Recovery Linux Manager).</p>

SUMMARY:Benchmarking LLVM using Embench
DESCRIPTION: <p>Dhrystone and Coremark have been the defacto standard microcontroller benchmark suites for the last thirty years, but these benchmarks no longer reflect the needs of modern embedded systems. Embench™ was explicitly designed to meet the requirements of modern connected embedded systems. The benchmarks are free, relevant, portable, and well implemented.</p><p>In this talk we will present the results of benchmarking Clang/LLVM for various IoT class architectures using Embench. We shall look at- how code size and speed varies across architectures when compiling with Clang/LLVM.- how Clang/LLVM performance has evolved over time- how Clang/LLVM compares against other compilers, notably GCC- the effectiveness of various compilation techniques (LTO, Combined Elimination, Profile Guided Optimization)</p><p>The aim is not to show which architecture or compiler is best, but to gain insight into the detail of the compilation process, so that all compilers and architectures can learn from each other.</p>

SUMMARY:BPF as a revolutionary technology for the container landscape
DESCRIPTION: <p>BPF as a foundational technology in the Linux kernel provides a powerful tool for systems developers and users to dynamically reprogram and customize the kernel to meet their needs in order to solve real-world problems and without having to be a kernel expert. Thanks to BPF we have come to the point to overcome having to carry legacy accumulated over decades of development grounded in a more traditional networking environment that is typically far more static than your average Kubernetes cluster. In the age of containers, they are no longer the best tool for the job, especially in terms of performance, reliability, scalability, and operations. This talk provides a few examples on how BPF allows to rethink container networking based on recent work we did in Cilium. Among others, the audience will learn about running a fully functioning Kubernetes cluster without iptables, Netfilter and thus without kube-proxy in a scalable and secure way with the help of BPF and Cilium.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>There is a multitude of software or code ecosystems: Linux distribution packages, language-specific (e.g. Python or node.js) modules, third-party desktop themes, git repositories, and recently also Flatpak and Snap. Users thus obtain software and code mainly from the network. This talk explores what can go wrong in such code delivery mechanisms, and what actually went wrong when a new threat has materialized: networks in certain countries started to be unreliable "thanks" to the governments (classical example: https://isitblockedinrussia.com/?host=7-zip.org == true). And what technical steps can be done in order for the said ecosystems to survive when censorship and overblocking spreads over the globe even more.</p>

SUMMARY:Creating symphonies in JavaScript
DESCRIPTION: <p>In 1996 I read about György Ligeti’s mechanical music (notably Poème Symphonique) and started to explore the possibility of precisely timed music. Knowing that computers now allowed more programmatic control over sound than they did in 1962, when Ligeti's wrote his piece, I set about writing algorithms to generate MIDI files which ultimately became Symphony 1 in C# minor.</p>

SUMMARY:Astarte: A Data-First approach to IoT
DESCRIPTION: <p>Even though the IoT buzz has been around for years, ecosystems are still scattered and developers must usually patch together a number of solutions to achieve their goals. Astarte is a free software, opinionated "blackbox" solution which aims at empowering developers with a platform which puts Data as the first-class citizen rather than focusing on Device-to-Cloud communication, and can scale to production-tier deployments easily.</p>

SUMMARY:Efficient Model Selection for Deep Neural Networks on Massively Parallel Processing Databases
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this session we will present an efficient way to train many deep learning model configurations at the same time with Greenplum, a free and open source massively parallel database based on PostgreSQL.  The implementation involves distributing data to the workers that have GPUs available and hopping model state between those workers, without sacrificing reproducibility or accuracy.   Then we apply optimization algorithms to generate and prune the set of model configurations to try.</p>

SUMMARY:Do you really see what’s happening on your NFV infrastructure?
DESCRIPTION: <p>As CoSP’s accelerate their adoption of SDN and NFV technologies, the increased need for metrics, performance measurement and benchmarking becomes a focus, to ensure the continued delivery of “best in class” services. As NFV environments have grown in size and complexity, the tools required to gain this greater visibility into the NFVi need to continue to evolve to meet the requirements for manageability, serviceability and resiliency.</p><p>Using Collectd as a metrics collection tool, OPNFV Barometer monitors the performance of the NFVi resources and has the capability to expose these insights via open industry standard interfaces to analytics or MANO components for potential enforcement or corrective actions.  Barometer works with related open source technologies and communities (collectd, DPDK, OpenStack, Prometheus, SAF, etc.) to provide numerous metrics and events that address various different use cases such as service healing, power optimization and ensuring application QoS.</p>

SUMMARY:gr-satellites latests developments
DESCRIPTION: <p>gr-satellites is a GNU Radio out-of-tree module with the goal of decoding every Amateur satellite. Currently it supports more than 80 different satellites. After GNU Radio 3.8 was released last summer, gr-satellites is seeing a lot of development and important changes. A refactored version, which will be released as gr-satellites 3.0 is on the works. This version brings more modularity to avoid code duplication, more flexibility in the input and output that the user can employ, and the idea to improve its integrability with other tools. Satellites are defined using a YAML file and the GNU Radio flowgraph is constructed on the fly by a Python script by connecting so called "component" blocks. Advanced users can also use the components directly in their own flowgraphs. This talk gives an overview of the gr-satellites 3.0 development progress.</p>

SUMMARY:Securing Existing Software using Formally Verified Libraries
DESCRIPTION: <p>Security vulnerabilities are still very common in todays software. Formal methods could improve the situation, but program verification remains a complex and time-consuming task. Often, the verification of existing software is infeasible and a complete rewrite can be prohibitively expensive. Both, however, is not necessarily required to improve on the current state. By replacing critical parts of an existing software by verified code, security can be strengthened significantly with moderate effort.</p><p>We show the feasibility of this approach by the example of a FLOSS TLS implementation. The basis of our PoC is the TLS 1.3 library <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/fizz">Fizz</a> which is written in C++. The existing message parser was replaced by a verified version implemented in the <a href="https://www.adacore.com/about-spark">SPARK</a> language. Our <a href="https://github.com/Componolit/RecordFlux">RecordFlux</a> toolset was used to automatically generate the parser based on a formal message specification. With the SPARK tools we can prove automatically that an attacker cannot cause any overflows, runtime errors or undefined state by sending malformed messages to the modified library. Because of mismatches in the data structures used in C++ and SPARK, some glue code had to be written manually to integrate the verified parser into Fizz. Still, the modified TLS implementation shows only a slight performance loss while providing higher security.</p>

Apparently, not every developer, application or organization is ready for Kubernetes…</p><p>In this presentation we will share a real world use case: deploying and configuring a brand new natural history museum. We’ll show how we built the museum with open source software and config management tools, dealing with a broad set of technologies, a tight schedule, a sector dominated by traditional organizations fixated on proprietary solutions and a whole bunch of actual fossils. We’ll show how far we’ve come, and what choices we made along the way.</p><p>Check out this talk if you want to see how Ansible, MAAS, PlatformIO, Nextcloud and other tools were used to not just automatically deploy and configure Linux based media players, games and digital signage screens, but also to manage Cumulus Linux-based switches, OPNsense firewalls, show controllers, Arduino microcontrollers, KNX gateways, projectors and even the odd OSX machine.</p>

SUMMARY:Building an embedded VoIP network for video intercom systems
DESCRIPTION: <p>IP video intercom systems combined with smartphones can leverage regular RTP/SIP VoIP technology to offer a new set of services to end-users: getting a notification when visitors press the door bell, seeing them on video before answering the call, interacting with them via voice and video and deciding to open the door, at home or anywhere else via wifi or 3G coverage.</p><p>Linphone (a SIP user-agent) and Flexisip (a SIP proxy server) can be integrated into IP video door phones, in-house panels and video surveillance devices to build a complete VoIP network.</p><p>Linphone and Flexisip use open standards to reliably send the audio and video streams captured from IP video intercoms to in-house devices, including smartphones and tablets, connected either to a local network or to the public internet.These open source SIP-based software solutions can run perfectly on small hardware devices with reduced footprint, and can easily be integrated into GNU/Linux embedded systems, thanks to their Yocto packages.</p><p>This lecture will describe how Linphone and Flexisip can be used together to build an embedded SIP network dedicated to home automation or video surveillance.The network architecture used in these contexts can also be deployed in other areas, such as the emergency services or the Internet of Things.</p>

SUMMARY:Asynchronous Directory Operations in CephFS
DESCRIPTION: <p>Metadata-heavy workloads are often the bane of networked and clustered filesystems. Directory operations (create and unlink, in particular) usually involve making a synchronous request to a server on the network, which can be very slow.</p><p>CephFS however has a novel mechanism for delegating the ability for clients to do certain operations locally. While that mechanism has mostly been used to delegate capabilities on normal files in the past, it's possible to extend this to cover certain types of directory operations as well.</p><p>The talk will describe work that is being done to bring asynchronous directory operations to CephFS. It will cover the design and tradeoffs necessary to allow for asynchronous directory operations, discuss the server and client-side infrastructure being added to support it, and what performance gains we expect to gain from this.</p>

SUMMARY:How Safe is Asynchronous Master-Master Setup?
DESCRIPTION: <p>It is common knowledge that built-in asynchronous master-master (active-active) replication is not safe. I remember times when the official MySQL User Reference Manual stated that such an installation is not recommended for production use. Some experts repeat this claim even now.</p><p>While this statement is generally true, I worked with thousands of shops that successfully avoided asynchronous replication limitations in active-active setups.</p><p>In this talk, I will show how they did it, demonstrate situations when asynchronous master-master replication is the best possible high availability option and beats such solutions as Galera or InnoDB Clusters. I will also cover common mistakes, leading to disasters.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT Open Source - Killing standards organizations or saving them
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open source communities move quickly, value running code, and docs are best effort at best. Standards move slowly, value precise specs, and negotiate compromises for broad alignment. Given these differences, why would open source communities fraternize with standards orgs? Standards orgs such as IETF and MEF realize they need to change to remain relevant. By embracing open source, standards orgs benefit from the speed and collaborative spirit of open source and get timely feedback on the clarity and correctness of standards as they evolve in parallel with running code. Open source communities gain users, address additional use cases, and gain the stability of standards to ease integration efforts and avoid forks. This session explores this evolution in standards orgs, highlights areas of mutual interest, and shares ideas on the benefit of closer collaboration.</p><p>Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "Open Source for students, by students" that was due to have been given by Kristin Yim. Also this talk was originally scheduled to be given at 10:00.</p>

SUMMARY:Building IoT solutions with Eclipse IoT technology
DESCRIPTION: <p>The  IoT working group within the Eclipse Foundation is a joint effort to develop generic building blocks for creating IoT solutions. As of now, they host over 30 projects, which address different aspects of the realization of IoT use cases. The vast number of projects allow the design of tailored IoT solutions but bear the risk that people get lost in the wide range of projects. The recently introduced project Eclipse IoT packages will help here. It aims to provide pre-bundled software packages for the IoT.</p><p>In this talk, we are going to introduce the work of the Eclipse IoT working group and showcase selected projects with the focus on how one can use those technologies to build custom domain specific IoT solutions. Specifically, we will focus on the message hub Eclipse Hono,, the digital twin solution Eclipse Ditto, the update manager Eclipse hawkBit and Eclipse Vorto a description language for IoT devices. We further plan to show how one can combine and use the projects in a sensible way within the Eclipse IoT packages project.</p>

SUMMARY:Building Loosely-coupled RISC-V Accelerators
DESCRIPTION: <p>The burgeoning RISC-V <em>hardware</em> ecosystem includes a number of microprocessor implementations [1, 3] and SoC generation frameworks [1, 2, 7]. However, while accelerator “sockets” have been defined and used (e.g., Rocket Chip’s custom coprocessor/RoCC), accelerators require <em>additional</em> collateral to be generated like structured metadata descriptions, hardware wrappers, and device drivers. Requiring manual effort to generate this collateral proves both time consuming and error prone and is at odds with an agile approach to hardware design. However, the existence and use of hardware construction languages and hardware compilers provides a means to automate this process. Through the use of the Chisel hardware description language [4] and the FIRRTL hardware compiler [5], we provide a definition of an abstract accelerator template which users then implement to integrate an accelerator with the Embedded Scalable Platform (ESP) System-on-Chip platform [2, 8]. Through the use of this template, we are able to automatically generate XML metadata necessary to integrate accelerators with the ESP platform and work on generating all collateral is in progress. Our accelerator template is open source software provided under an Apache 2.0 license [6].</p><p>[1] CHIPS alliance Rocket-chip. <em>GitHub Repository</em>.

SUMMARY:Monitoring strawberries
DESCRIPTION: <p>According to the United Nations, 2.5 billion more people will be living in cities by 2050. This trend has caused indoor farming to draw a lot of attention and effort in recent years, in an attempt to scale the production of highly nutritious, healthy food inside cities.</p><p>Over the past 3 years, Agricool has recycled 20 industrial containers into farms that grow strawberries, herbs and salads, in the very heart of cities, and without any pesticide. These urban farms are currently operated in Paris and Dubaï.</p><p>Operating a fleet of indoor farms presents a diverse set of observability challenges. At the most traditional end of the observability spectrum, engineers rely on devops tools to operate computers, microservices, and an IoT infrastructure embedded inside the farms. On the other hand, living organisms like strawberry plants draw their own observability requirements, such as disease detection, physiological measurements, nutrient absorption, water analysis, or exposition rate to pollinating bumblebees.</p><p>The purpose of this talk is to highlight observability challenges and best practices that are specific to indoor farming, and to illustrate them through the learnings that were made at Agricool when building observability pipelines.</p>

SUMMARY:TornadoVM: A Virtual Machine for Exploiting ​High-Performance Heterogeneous ​Execution of Java Programs​
DESCRIPTION: <p>The proliferation of heterogeneous hardware in recent years has driven us to consider that every system we program, most likely includes a mix of computing elements; each of which with different hardware characteristics enabling programmers to improve performance while reducing energy consumption. These new heterogeneous devices include multi-core CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. This trend has been accompanied by changes in software development norms that do not necessarily favor programmers. A prime example is the two most popular heterogeneous programming languages, CUDA and OpenCL, which expose several low-level features to the API making them difficult to use by non-expert users.</p><p>Instead of using low-level programming languages, developers in industry and academia tend to use higher-level, object-oriented programming languages, typically executed on managed runtime environments, such as Java, R, and Javascript. Although many programmers might expect that such programming languages would have already been adapted for transparent execution on heterogeneous hardware, the reality is that their support is either very limited or absent.</p><p>In this talk, we present TornadoVM (https://github.com/beehive-lab/TornadoVM), a heterogeneous programming framework for Java programs. TornadoVM co-exists with standard JVMs (e.g., OpenJDK) that implement the JVMCI. TornadoVM consists of three components: 1) a simple API for composing pipelines of existing Java methods, 2) an optimizing JIT compiler that extends the Graal compiler with hardware-aware optimizations that generate OpenCL C code, and 3) a runtime system that executes TornadoVM specific bytecodes, performs memory management, and schedules the code for execution on GPUs, multicore CPUs, and FPGAs. Essentially, TornadoVM is a “VM-in-a-VM” that can adapt execution completely dynamically and transparently to the user, always finding the highest-performing combination of hardware accelerators through dynamic reconfiguration.</p>

SUMMARY:SWIM - Protocol to Build a Cluster
DESCRIPTION: <p>SWIM - is a relatively new protocol to discover and monitor cluster nodes, to disseminate events and data between them. The protocol is extremely lightweight, decentralised, and its speed and load per node do not depend on cluster size.</p><p>The protocol solves several tasks at once. First - build and keep up to date topology of a cluster without explicit configuration. The task is quite intricate because:</p><ul><li>new just started nodes know nothing about others, and they should somehow discover them;</li><li>already working nodes can fail, and it should be detected so as to change a master, or evict an unrecoverable node from the cluster, or restart it.</li></ul><p>According to the protocol, cluster nodes broadcast packets and send p2p ping requests. Broadcast helps to discover new nodes, p2p pings help to detect failure of a known node.</p><p>A second task - events dissemination in a cluster. Event is a node failure; UUID change; IP address update; new node appearance - anything that affects cluster state. Sometimes users define their own event types. When a node learns about an event, it needs to disseminate the event to other nodes. SWIM protocol describes an algorithm how to detect and disseminate events, and gives the following guarantees:</p><ul><li>it takes a constant time to learn about an event on at least one node in the cluster;</li><li>it takes logarithmic from cluster size time to disseminate that event to each node of the cluster.</li></ul><p>In the talk I tell about how SWIM works, how and with which essential improvements it was implemented, how to use SWIM, and what are the practical performance results.</p><p>Implementation is a part of Tarantool DBMS. Tarantool is the biggest Russian Open-Source DBMS. Tarantool currently goes toward better scalability, improvements in horizontal scaling, in cluster-wide calculations, and better cluster management. In scope of that roadmap SWIM protocol implementation was recently released.</p>

SUMMARY:The Ethics Behind Your IoT
DESCRIPTION: <p>Internet of Things (IoT) devices are part of the future we were promised. Armed with our mobile devices, we can control everything from our cars to our toasters to the doors of our homes. Along with convenience, IoT devices bring us ethical quandaries, as designers and users. We need to consider the ethical implicates of the technologies we are building and ask ourselves not just about the ways they are being used, for both good and evil, but the potential use cases we might encounter in the future.</p>

SUMMARY:Deterministic debugging with Delve
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk I will begin by delivering the "State of Delve" update. In similar fashion to the popular "State of Go" talk I will begin by discussing all of the exciting new features and changes that have happened over the past year, since last FOSDEM. Following that I will go into a live demo showcasing how Delve can leverage Mozilla RR in order to perform deterministic debugging. This talk will begin by introducing users to the concept of deterministic debugging and the power that comes with it. Following that I will launch into a demo showcasing how to leverage this concept to debug an otherwise unpredictable highly concurrent program. Users will walk away with immediate practical knowledge they can begin applying in their day to day debugging.</p>

SUMMARY:Why open infrastructure matters
DESCRIPTION: <p>A lot of open source developers choose to deploy their software on infrastructure based on proprietary software. Behind this apparent paradox is the need to adapt to changing environments, adopt new technologies fast, and use increasing amounts of computing power. Open infrastructure (computing, networking and storage infrastructure based on open source software) has a lot to offer, but it's easy to overlook if you don't take the time to take a step back and analyze the situation rationally. In this talk, Thierry Carrez, VP of Engineering at the OSF, explains all the reasons why open infrastructure matters, and why it makes sense for you to adopt it today.</p>

SUMMARY:A free toolchain for 0.01 € - computers
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Taiwanese company Padauk makes small 8-bit microcontrollers, the smallest of which are available at 0.01 € even in small quantities. Even the larger ones are just a few cents; a particularly interestign feature is the hardware multithreading support available in larger devices.Until recently, the only available toolchain was Padauk's non-free toolchain based around their "MINI-C" IDE (which despite, the name, ist just a bit of C-like syntactic sugar coating for assembler, and in no way a C implementation).</p><p>In 2019, an effort to provide a free alternative resulted in a full free toolchain. Documentation beyond that provided by Padauk was created by reverse-engineering. A free design for a programmer along with firmware was created. Assembler, simulator and a Small Device C Compiler (SDCC) backend were written.</p>

SUMMARY:Why is Django 3.0 a revolution for building websites with Python?
DESCRIPTION: <p>For almost 20 years, we relied on a CGI based protocol called WSGI to use Python to handle HTTP requests and responses software.Because Python is singled threaded we relied on a couple of hacks such as Gunicorn or uWSGI to share a socket through multiple processes.However the cost of all these multiple processes was a bit heavy and error prone.</p><p>Through Django Channels Andrew Godwin paved the way for a better way of creating web services with Python. This work landed in Django 3.0.Let's explore how it works and why it worth it!</p>

SUMMARY:Language Server Protocol & Debug Adapter Protocol to the Rescue of Web Development in Eclipse IDE
DESCRIPTION: <p>The state of Web (HTML, CSS, JS...) development in Eclipse IDE used to be bad. Indeed, some internal parsers had to be maintained to follow the frequent and major changes in those standards; the developer community behind them couldn't catch up, leading tools to a pretty bad and outdated state. Fortunately, the rise of technologies like TextMate grammars, Language Servers and Debug Adapters as reusable components have allowed Eclipse ecosystem to catch up with the best tools for web development. By integrating pieces of VSCode and others and with a relatively small investment, Eclipse Wild Web Developer provides a quite comfortable and efficient tool set for a wide variety of web-based projects. In this presentation, we'll demo Wild Web Developer in practicie, explaining as we demo how the LSP/DAP world is leveraged to enable those productive workflows.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Coroutines are great, I think we all agree on that. But as the async, and possibly parallel, programming becomes easier the risk of sharing mutable variables between coroutines arises.</p><p>When the boundaries are abstracted away we should rely on safe ways to communicate between our coroutines.</p><p>In this session, I will go through safe and unsafe ways of communication between different coroutines, and why it's not safe to think of them purely as threads.</p>

SUMMARY:Open Adult Education: a curriculum to bridge the digital skills gap with free and open source technologies
DESCRIPTION: <p>The OPEN-AE project is developing an open, and modular curriculum directed to train e-facilitators and trainers working with people who are in need of upskilling and reskilling in free and open-culture. The OPEN AE curriculum is meant to be modular and adaptable to the immediate training needs of the efacilitators. The training aims to introduce the trainers to the values of free and open-culture and empower them with the values behind this culture so it can be transmitted to low-skilled adults. the training will also have modules supporting a transition to free and open source software and culture.  Open-AE is not merely about teaching free and open softwares, but aims to have the trainers be active participants in the culture, knowing how to license these openly how to collaborate and develop as a collective.</p>

SUMMARY:Spotlight on Free Software Building Blocks for a Secure Health Data Infrastructure
DESCRIPTION: <p>Health Data is traditionally held and processed in large and complex mazes of hospital information systems. The market is dominated by vendors offering monolithic and proprietary software due to the critical nature of the supported processes and - in some cases - due to legal requirements. The “digital transformation”, “big data” and “artificial intelligence” are some of the hypes that demand for improved exchange of health care data in routine health care and medical research alike. Exchanging data at these scales requires open data formats and protocols, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and agile development. As an example, the de-facto messaging standard organization in medicine HL7 noticed a much more positive response from the medical research community regarding their openly available FHIR specification in comparison to the for-members-only and XML-based HL7v3 messaging standard specification.While some past (or rather: ongoing) projects on a national scale in the German health care system have tried centralized, top-down specification and development approaches, more recent infrastructure projects embrace the competitive collaboration of a decentralized, bottom-up strategy. As a result, importance and recognition of free software increase in the Medical Informatics research community.</p><p>In a series of rapid spotlights, we present tools and frameworks that serve as cornerstones for the envisioned health data exchange infrastructure, including: Organization and collaboration tools; data extraction from clinical source systems, data transformation and de-identification; data management systems and long-term archival using persistent globally-unique object identifiers; federated queries across multiple independently managed clinical data integration centers.</p><p>We aim to encourage participants to actively add tools and frameworks within the discussion and highlight their experiences and challenges with using open systems in Medical Informatics.</p>

SUMMARY:Lightweight virtualization in the Cloud and at the Edge
DESCRIPTION: <p>Running applications in the Cloud has changed the way users develop and shiptheir code. Quite recently, the community has given rise to microservices-basedapproaches, towards solutions that follow the paradigm of Platform-, Software-,and Function-as-a-Service (PaaS, SaaS, and FaaS respectively).</p><p>To accommodate user demands, while maintaining security and isolation, Cloudvendors have adopted a hybrid approach where user workloads are being executedin lightweight sandboxed environments, where micro-hypervisors provide theisolation and container-based images facilitate application deployment. As aresult, lighter virtualization stacks remains a key aspect to maximizeperformance in a multi-tenant but isolated environment.</p><p>To this end, we started experimenting with various Virtual Machine Monitors(VMMs) that could provide the ideal trade-off between performance, flexibilityand application portability. In this talk, we present the design of a minimalVMM, based on KVM, residing entirely in the Linux Kernel and showcase themerits and shortcomings (minimal footprint, security concerns), for eachuse-case (Cloud FaaS, edge multi-tenancy). Additionally, we present ourexperience from porting Firecracker to a low-power device (RPi4) demonstratingthe merits of lightweight hypervisor stacks for flexible application executionat the edge.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk I will present EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution – especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves. EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted, depending on security requirements and performance demands.</p><p>Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to begin at the later time of 12:25</p>

SUMMARY:DEBATE: Does Careful Inventory of Licensing Bill of Materials Have Real Impact on FOSS License Compliance?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Projects today often have thousands of FOSS dependencies. Since riskflows downstream in the supply chain; projects inherit and pass on therisks of all their dependencies. In response, licensing bill ofmaterials tools often seek to push well-formed licensing inventorydata upstream in an effort to ease downstream compliancechallenges. At the same time, there has been a stark increase inlicense violations, especially, though not exclusively, on copyleftlicenses. Is this approach to improving compliance working?</p>

SUMMARY:A Deep Dive into PostgreSQL Indexing
DESCRIPTION: <p>Indexes are a basic feature of relational databases, and PostgreSQL offers a rich collection of options to developers and designers. To take advantage of these fully, users need to understand the basic concept of indexes, to be able to compare the different index types and how they apply to different application scenarios. Only then can you make an informed decision about your database index strategy and design. One thing is for sure: not all indexes are appropriate for all circumstances, and using a ‘wrong’ index can have the opposite effect that you intend and problems might only surface once in production. Armed with more advanced knowledge, you can avoid this worst-case scenario! We’ll take a look at how to use pg<em>stat</em>statment to find opportunities for adding indexes to your database. We’ll take a look at when to add an index, and when adding an index is unlikely to result in a good solution. So should you add an index to every column? Come and discover why this strategy is rarely recommended as we take a deep dive into PostgreSQL indexing.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT RTC: A sea of opportunities
DESCRIPTION: <p>The love for technology is what binds us and pushes us to keep improving. Though there are a lot of thriving RTC projects, collaboration between them is rare. This results in duplication of efforts, differing standards and lack of interoperability. In this session we will discuss the opportunities that lie in wait for the Free RTC space and how we're trying to tackle some of these issues through the Open VoIP Alliance.</p><p>NOTE: This is a late addition to the schedule to fill a gap left by a speaker who cancelled.</p>

SUMMARY:Testing DoH and DoT servers, compliance and performance
DESCRIPTION: <p>Of course, encrypting DNS is necessary for privacy and security, likefor every other Internet protocol. That's why DoT and DoH deploymentis very important, so that users could safely go to a resolver theytrust. Now, it is time to assert the technical compliance andperformance of these trusted resolvers. We will talk about the thingsthat could and should be tested against DoT and DoH servers and how toimplement it. We will then discuss performance measurements, speciallywith the opportunities brought by parallelism (both in DoT and DoH)and the challenges they create for measurements.This talk will be inspired by the development of a tool which is, atthis stage, in a very alpha state.</p>

SUMMARY:The consequences of sync_binlog != 1
DESCRIPTION: <p>Have you ever needed to get some additional write throughput from MySQL ?  If yes, you probably found that setting sync_binlog to 0 (and trx_commit to 2) gives you an extra performance boost.  As all such easy optimisation, it comes at a cost.  This talk explains how this tuning works, presents its consequences and makes recommendations to avoid them.  This will bring us to the details of how MySQL commits transactions and how those are replicated to slaves.  Come to this talk to learn how to get the benefit of this tuning the right way and to learn some replication internals.</p>

SUMMARY:Lisp everywhere!
DESCRIPTION: <p>Minimalism matters in computing. Minimalism allows for smaller systemsthat take less resources and consume less energy. More importantly,free and open source minimalism allows for secure systems that areeasy to understand. Minimalism is also educational and brings back thefun of the early days of computing where people learn to understandsystems from the ground up. As a co-organizer of this devroom I willtalk about my journey through many programming languages and ending upwith Scheme (a minimal Lisp). Lisp is the second oldest language inuse today and growing. I'll show you that once you master Lisp you canuse it everywhere from software deployment, the shell, the editor anddebugging and for programming systems and in the browser. As a matterof fact, Lisp is everywhere!</p>

SUMMARY:ERASER: Early-stage Reliability And Security Estimation for RISC-V
DESCRIPTION: <p>RISC-V processors have gained acceptance across a wide range of computing domains, from IoT to embedded/mobile class and even in server-class processing systems. In processing systems ranging from connected cars and autonomous vehicles, to those on-board satellites and spacecrafts, these processors are targeted to function in safety-critical systems, where Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS)-based considerations are of paramount importance. Along with potential system vulnerabilities caused primarily due to random errors, these processors may also be sensitive to targeted errors, possibly from malicious entities, which raises serious concerns regarding the security and safety of the processing system. Consequently, such systems necessitate the incorporation of RAS-based considerations right from an early stage of processor design.</p><p>While the hardware and software ecosystem around RISC-V has been steadily maturing, there have, however, been limited developments in early stage reliability-aware design and verification. The Early-stage Reliability And Security Estimation for RISC-V (ERASER) tool attempts to address this shortcoming. It consists of an open source framework aimed at providing directions to incorporate such reliability and security features at an early, pre-silicon stage of design. These features may include what kind of protection to be applied and which components within the processor should they be applied to. The proposed infrastructure comprises of an open source toolchain for early stage modeling of latch vulnerability in a RISC-V core (SERMiner [1]), a tool for automated generation of stress marks that maximize the likelihood of a transient-failure induced error (Microprobe (RISC-V) [2]), and verification by means of statistical and/or targeted fault injection (Chiffre [3]). While the infrastructure is targeted towards any core that uses the RISC-V ISA, the repository provides an end-to-end flow for the Rocket core [4].</p><p>ERASER thus evaluates “RAS-readiness”, or the effectiveness of protection techniques in processor design such that processor vulnerability in terms of Failures-In-time (FIT) rate is minimized, for a specified power/performance overhead. FIT rate is defined as the number of failures in one billion hours of operation and is a standard vulnerability metric used in industry.</p><p>ERASER is an open source tool available for download at https://github.com/IBM/eraser. The tool currently supports analysis of all latches in the design across a single Rocket core and the generation of stressmarks that can be used to evaluate the vulnerability of these latches. In addition to radiation-induced soft errors, we plan to extend ERASER to also model errors due to voltage noise, thermal and aging-induced failures, both in memory and logic, and generate representative stressmarks.</p><p>ERASER is an initial effort to devise a comprehensive methodology for RAS analysis, particularly for open-source hardware, with the hope that it spurs further research and development into reliability-aware design both in industry and academia.</p><p>References:</p><ol><li><p>K.

SUMMARY:Endless Network Programming − An Update from eBPF Land
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Linux kernel networking capabilities have been undergoing major changes over the last years. At the heart of the performance gain, eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and XDP (eXpress Data Path) have brought new possibilities in terms of tracing and network packet processing. eBPF is a trendy topic in the Linux world, and today it needs little introduction among the SDN and NFV community. But the technology is still under heavy development, bringing new features, more flexibility, and better performance to the users. This presentation is an update on the latest evolutions in the eBPF world!</p><p>Many of those changes occur directly inside the eBPF subsystem architecture. New program types are being added. Early constraints such as the maximal number of instructions for programs, or the unavailability of loops, are changing. The internals are improved with support for debug information (BTF) or 32-bit instructions. And many new mechanisms are implemented, such as global data support, the “BPF trampoline”, batched map operations, dynamic linking. Let's review all the latest trends in eBPF kernel development!</p><p>But beyond kernel code, eBPF has grown as a full ecosystem, with a variety of tools used to work with it, or to build upon it. Bpftool, a reference utility to manage eBPF programs, keeps evolving. The networking projects using eBPF keep growing in number (e.g. Katran, Suricata, Sysdig, Hubble, Libkefir) or in features (e.g. Cilium). Let's review (briefly) some of those projects that assert eBPF as one of the essential fast dataplane solutions in the Linux world.</p>

SUMMARY:Choosing The Right Deployment Strategy
DESCRIPTION: <p>Deployment strategies affect everyone, no matter whether we are focused only on a single aspect of the application lifecycle or we are in full control. The way we deploy affects the architecture, testing, monitoring, and many other aspects. And not only that, but we can say that architecture, testing, and monitoring affect the way we deploy. All those things are closely related and affect each other.</p><p>We'll discuss different deployment strategies and answer a couple of questions. Is your application stateful or stateless? Does its architecture permit scaling? How do you roll back? How do you scale up and down? Do you need your application to run always? Should you use Kubernetes Deployments instead of, let's say, StatefulSets? Answers to those questions will not serve much unless we are familiar with some of the most commonly used deployment strategies. Not only that knowledge will help us choose which one to pick, but they might even influence the architecture of our applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Towards CadQuery 2.0
DESCRIPTION: <p>CadQuery (CQ) [1] is a Python library for building of parametric 3D models. The overarchingdesign goal is to be extremely fluent and as close as possible to the design intent. CQ is based onthe open source CAD kernel from OpenCascade and therefor offers industry standard B-Repmodeling capabilities and allows exporting to lossless formats such as STEP as well as lossy onessuch as STL. Originally it used Python bindings based on FreeCAD [2] but recently we switched toPythonOCC [3] to be more flexible and have full access to the underlying CAD kernel capabilities.In the talk I will summarize the current status of the CQ project, show some interestingusage examples and discuss newly implemented features. Furthermore I will elaborate on the futureplans of the core development team and touch on some of the challenges of maintaining a projectsuch as CQ. I will also present a fairly new addition to the CQ ecosystem – CQ-editor [3]. It is aPython/PyQt5 based lightweight cross-platform GUI editor that allows to quickly develop andpreview CQ 3D models. It also offers graphical debugging and CQ stack introspection capabilitieswhich dramatically lowers the entry barrier for trying out and using CQ.</p><p>References</p><p>[1] https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery[2] https://www.freecadweb.org[3] https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core[4] https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor</p>

SUMMARY:Evolution of kube-proxy
DESCRIPTION: <p>Kube-proxy enables access to Kubernetes services (virtual IPs backed by pods) by configuring client-side load-balancing on nodes. The first implementation relied on a userspace proxy which was not very performant. The second implementation used iptables and is still the one used in most Kubernetes clusters. Recently, the community introduced an alternative based on IPVS.This talk will start with a description of the different modes and how they work. It will then focus on the IPVS implementation, the improvements it brings, the issues we encountered and how we fixed them as well as the remaining challenges and how they could be addressed. Finally, the talk will present alternative solutions based on eBPF such as Cilium.</p>

SUMMARY:ByteBuffers are dead, long live ByteBuffers!
DESCRIPTION: <p>Abstract: Direct buffers are, to date, the only way to access foreign,off-heap memory. Despite their success, direct buffers suffer from somelimitations --- stateful-ness, lack of addressing space,non-deterministic deallocation to name a few --- which makes them aless-than-ideal choice under certain workloads. In this talk we paintthe path to the future: a safe, supported and efficient foreign memoryaccess API for Java. By providing a more targeted solution to theproblem of accessing foreign memory, not only developers will be freedby the above limitations - but they will also enjoy improvedperformances, as the new API is designed from the ground-up with JIToptimizations in mind - and all without sacrificing memory access safety.</p>

SUMMARY:Platform independent CPU/FPGA co-design: the OscImp-Digital framework
DESCRIPTION: <p>Combining the flexibility of FPGA hardware configuration with the high abstraction level of an operating system running on a general purpose central processing unit (CPU) requires mastering a broad range of knowledge, from low level hardware configuration to kernel drivers to libraries and userspace application. While some vendor specific frameworks tackle the challenge, we focus on a vendor independent solution applicable to current FPGA Systen on Chip providers: the OscImp Digital framework provides a comprehensive set of FPGA IP, associated Linux driver, library and userspace examples based on GNU Radio running on the embedded CPU. We demonstrate its use on the Redpitaya platform processing baseband signals as well as the Zynq, most significantly associated with the AD9363 radiofrequency frontend on the PlutoSDR board. In both cases, the FPGA is not only used to stream I/Q coefficients but pre-process the datastream in order to reduce bandwidth and efficiently feed the CPU: we demonstrate embedded FM broadcast radio reception as well as GPS decoding on the PlutoSDR custom bitstream. The framework is available at https://github.com/oscimp/oscimpDigital</p>

SUMMARY:RISC-V Software and Firmware Development in the Cloud Using OpenPiton+Ariane on Amazon F1
DESCRIPTION: <p>RISC-V application, OS, and firmware development has been slowed by the lack of "real hardware" available for developers to work with. With the rise of FPGAs in the cloud and the recent release of the OpenPiton+Ariane manycore platform on Amazon's F1 cloud FPGA platform, we propose using 1-12 core OpenPiton+Ariane processors emulated on F1 to develop RISC-V software and firmware. In this talk, we will give an accelerated tutorial on how to get started with OpenPiton+Ariane, the spec-compliant RISC-V platform it offers, and how the firmware and OS can be modified and run on top. We will show a number of applications built and running for our present Debian distribution and the software development environment that this offers. We will then highlight how hardware and software can be co-designed on OpenPiton+Ariane with the ability to recompile the hardware underlying the cloud FPGA image and deploy it for use by others. This platform is serving as a basis for software and hardware development for the DECADES project, a project investigating heterogenous manycore and hardware accelerator based designs with support for orchestrated data movement.</p>

SUMMARY:Querying millions to billions of metrics with M3DB's inverted index
DESCRIPTION: <p>The cardinality of monitoring data we are collecting today continues to rise, in no small part due to the ephemeral nature of containers and compute platforms like Kubernetes. Querying a flat dataset comprised of an increasing number of metrics requires searching through millions and in some cases billions of metrics to select a subset to display or alert on. The ability to use wildcards or regex within the tag name and values of these metrics and traces are becoming less of a nice-to-have feature and more useful for the growing popularity of ad-hoc exploratory queries.</p><p>In this talk we will look at how Prometheus introduced the concept of a reverse index existing side-by-side with a traditional column based TSDB in a single process.  We will then walk through the evolution of M3’s metric index, starting with ElasticSearch and evolving over the years to the current M3DB reverse index. We will give an in depth overview of the alternate designs and dive deep into the architecture of the current distributed index and the optimizations we’ve made in order to fulfill wildcards and regex queries across billions of metrics.</p>

SUMMARY:DataLad
DESCRIPTION: <p>Contemporary sciences are heavily data-driven, but today's data management technologies and sharing practices fall at least a decade behind software ecosystem counterparts.Merely providing file access is insufficient for a simple reason: data are not static. Data often (and should!) continue to evolve; file formats can change, bugs will be fixed, new data are added, and derived data needs to be integrated.While (distributed) version control systems are a de-facto standard for open source software development, a similar level of tooling and culture is not present in the open data community.</p><p>The lecture introduces DataLad, a software that aims to address this problem by providing a feature-rich API (command line and Python) for joint management of all digital objects of science: source code, data artifacts (as much as their derivatives), and essential utilities, such as container images of employed computational environments.A DataLad dataset represents a comprehensive and actionable unit that can be used privately, or be published on today's cyberinfrastructure (GitLab, GitHub, Figshare, S3, Google Drive, etc.) to facilitate large and small-scale collaborations.</p><p>In addition to essential version control tasks, DataLad aids data discovery by supporting a plurality of evolving metadata description standards. Moreover, Datalad is able to capture data provenance information in a way that enables programmatic re-execution of computations, and as such provides a key feature for the implementation of reproducible science.DataLad is extensible and customizable to fine tune its functionality to specific domains (e.g., field of science or organizational requirements).</p><p>DataLad is built on a few key principles:</p><ol><li><p><strong>DataLad only knows about two things: Datasets and files.</strong>A DataLad dataset is a collection of files in folders.And a file is the smallest unit any dataset can contain.At its core, <strong>DataLad is a completely domain-agnostic, general-purpose tool to manage data</strong>.</p></li><li><p><strong>A dataset is a Git repository</strong>.A dataset is a Git repository. All features of the version control system Gitalso apply to everything managed by DataLad.</p></li><li><p><strong>A DataLad dataset can take care of managing and version controlling arbitrarily large data</strong>.To do this, it has an optional <em>annex</em> for (large) file content:Thanks to this annex, DataLad can track files that are TBs in size(something that Git could not do, and that allows you to restore previous versions of data,transform and work with it while capturing all provenance,or share it with whomever you want). At the same time, DataLad does all of the magicnecessary to get this important feature to work quietly in the background.The annex is set-up automatically, and the tool <a href="https://git-annex.branchable.com">git-annex</a> manages it all underneath the hood.</p></li><li><p>DataLad follows the social principle to<strong>minimize custom procedures and data structures</strong>. DataLad will not transformyour files into something that only DataLad or a specialized tool can read.A PDF file (or any other type offile) stays a PDF file (or whatever other type of file it was)whether it is managed by DataLad or not. This guarantees that users will not loosedata or data access if DataLad would vanish from their system, or even when DataLadwould vanish from the face of Earth. Using DataLad thus does not require or generatedata structures that can only be used or read with DataLad -- DataLad does nottie you down, it liberates you.</p></li><li><p>Furthermore, DataLad is developed for <strong>complete decentralization</strong>.There is no required central server or service necessary to use DataLad. In thisway, no central infrastructure needs to be maintained (or paid for) --your own laptop is the perfect place to live for your DataLad project, as is yourinstitutions webserver, or any other common computational infrastructure youmight be using.</p></li><li><p>Simultaneously, though, DataLad aims to<strong>maximize the (re-)use of existing 3rd-party data resources and infrastructure</strong>.Users <em>can</em> use existing central infrastructure should they want to.DataLad works with any infrastructure from GitHub toDropbox, Figshare, or institutional repositories,enabling users to harvest all of the advantages of their preferredinfrastructure without tying anyone down to central services.</p></li></ol>

SUMMARY:Reverse Geocoding is not easy
DESCRIPTION: <p>Having seen a dozen of different OpenStreetMap-based geocoders, I did not expect to find myself writing another one. But here I am, tasked with making a reverse geocoder better than the industry-standard Nominatim. Turns out it is a fun and not so straightforward task. Let’s see what can go wrong.</p>

SUMMARY:Which video network streaming protocol should I use?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Open source stacks such as GStreamer, ffmpeg and UPipe now implement a large number of different ways to stream audio &amp; video over a network. Just to name a few, there are RTSP, SRT, RIST, WebRTC, HLS, DASH, AES67, SmoothStreaming, RTMP! Some are for local networks and some target the Internet, depending on the use-case, these protocols have different upsides and downsides. To create a successful project, one needs to select the best suited technology. I'll go over the various protocols and explain how they relate to each other and their individual advantages and inconveniences.</p>

SUMMARY:JavaScript on Microcontrollers
DESCRIPTION: <p>Building an IoT device feels out of reach to a lot of web developers. Most of us didn’t study electrical engineering, and never learned to solder. And programming a microcontroller is on a completely different level than building a website.But that is just not true anymore. Nowadays microcontrollers have become powerful enough to run JavaScript. And that opens up IoT to all of us. With just 20 lines of code we can build a connected lightbulb, and within seconds we can wirelessly deploy it. Write a couple of lines more, and you can even remotely control a car. And that is precisely what we are going to do.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT A Tale of Two Worlds: Assessing the Vulnerability of Enclave Shielding Runtimes
DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk analyzes the vulnerability space arising in TrustedExecution Environments (TEEs) when interfacing a trusted enclaveapplication with untrusted, potentially malicious code. Considerableresearch and industry effort has gone into developing TEE runtimelibraries with the purpose of transparently shielding enclaveapplication code from an adversarial environment. However, our analysisreveals that shielding requirements are generally not well-understood inreal-world TEE runtime implementations. We expose several sanitizationvulnerabilities at the level of the Application Binary Interface (ABI)and the Application Programming Interface (API) that can lead toexploitable memory safety and side-channel vulnerabilities in thecompiled enclave. Mitigation of these vulnerabilities is not as simpleas ensuring that pointers are outside enclave memory. In fact, wedemonstrate that state-of-the-art mitigation techniques such as Intel’sedger8r, Microsoft’s “deep copy marshalling”, or even memory-safelanguages like Rust fail to fully eliminate this attack surface. Ouranalysis reveals 35 enclave interface sanitization vulnerabilities in 8major open-source shielding frameworks for Intel SGX, RISC-V, and SancusTEEs. We practically exploit these vulnerabilities in several attackscenarios to leak secret keys from the enclave or enable remote codereuse. We have responsibly disclosed our findings, leading to 5designated CVE records and numerous security patches in the vulnerableopen-source projects, including the Intel SGX-SDK, Microsoft OpenEnclave, Google Asylo, and the Rust compiler.</p><p>Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to begin at the later time of 13:00</p>

SUMMARY:Buildtest: HPC Software Stack Testing Framework 
DESCRIPTION: <p>HPC support teams are often tasked with installingscientific software for their user community and the complexity ofmanaging a large software stack gets very challenging. Softwareinstallation brings forth many challenges that requires a team ofdomain expertise and countless hours troubleshooting to build anoptimal software state that is tuned to the architecture. In the pastdecade, two software build tools (Easybuild, Spack) have emergedthat are widely accepted in HPC community to accelerate buildinga complete software stack for HPC systems. The support team areconstantly involved in fulfilling software request for end-userswhich leads to an ever-growing software ecosystem. Once asoftware is installed, the support team hands it off to the userwithout any testing because scientific software requires domainexpertise in order to test software. Some software packages areshipped with a test suite that can be run at post build while manysoftware have no mechanism for testing. This poses a knowledgegap between HPC support team and end-users on the type oftesting to do. Some HPC centers may have developed in-house testscripts that are suitable for testing their software, but these testsare not portable due to hardcoded paths and are often sitedependent. In addition, there is no collaboration between HPCsites in building a test repository that will benefit the community.In this talk I will presents buildtest, a framework to automate softwaretesting for a software stack along with several module operationsthat would be of interest to the HPC support team.</p>

SUMMARY:LLVM and GCC
DESCRIPTION: <p>At the GNU Tools Cauldron we held a panel discussion on how GCC and LLVM can work together. The video of that discussion can be seen at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnbJOSZXynA.  We proposed a similar discussion to be held at the LLVM Developers Meeting, but the reviewers suggested that such a discussion would be better held as part of the FOSDEM LLVM Devroom, since that was more likely to attract GNU developers as well.</p><p>We wish to explore how Clang/LLVM and the GCC can work together effectively.</p><p>The participants will explore opportunities for co-operation between the projects. Areas to be covered include:</p><ul><li>collaboration on issues related to language standards, changes to existing standards or implementing new ones;</li><li>maintaining ABI compatibility between the compilers;</li><li>interoperability between tools and libraries e.g. building with clang and libstdc++ or building with gcc and linking with lld; and</li><li>communication channels for developers via bugzilla or mailing lists.</li></ul><p>The compilers are part of wider projects providing all the components of the tool chain, and we anticipate the discussion will roam to low level utilities, source code debuggers and libraries as well.  We hope the output of the discussion will inform future work between the two communities.</p><p>The panelists are</p><ul><li><strong>Arnaud de Grandmaison</strong> is a Director of the Linux Foundation, currently working at Arm. He has been developing with LLVM for his last 10+ years, to support custom architecture or enable architecture exploration.</li><li><strong>Pedro Alves</strong> is a global mainainer and major contributor to the GNU Debugger (GDB)</li><li><strong>Tom Tromey</strong> is a long-time GNU maintainer.

SUMMARY:Bringing back ethics to open source
DESCRIPTION: <p>Most discussions around ethical licenses today consider the Open Source Definition (OSD) with the same reverence as Moses did the tablets delivered to him on Mount Sinai.</p><p>The OSD is in fact much more mundane than that. And it tells us more about its authors than about the open source movement in general; had open source been born in less privileged circles, ethical considerations would have been baked in from the start.</p><p>With that in mind, let's revisit what we're actually trying to collectively achieve through the open source movement and reconsider the notion that its mission requires we allow the software we build be used in violation of Human Rights.</p><p>There are minimally-disruptive changes that can be made to the OSD and to existing licenses which would puth ethical concerns centerstage, where they belong, and help us foster responsibility and accountability within our community and within software vendors.</p><p>We'll look at the past attempts at creating ethical licenses and why they have failed. We'll ask all of the hard questions, even those we don't have good answers to yet. And we'll propose a new, multi-pronged approach to this issue. One that we believe, while more demanding to implement, has a much better chance of success than previous attempts have had.</p>

SUMMARY:Working with spatial trajectories in Boost Geometry
DESCRIPTION: <p>Recently, there is a growing interest in geospatial trajectory computing. We call trajectories the sequences of time-stamped locations. As the technology for tracking moving objects becomes cheaper and more accurate, massive amounts of spatial trajectories are generated nowadays by smartphones, infrastructure, computer games, natural phenomena, and many other sources.</p><p>In this talk we will present the set of tools available in Boost Geometry to work with trajectories highlighting latest as well as older library developments. Starting with more basic operations like length, distance and closest points computations between trajectories we move forward to more advanced operations like compression or simplification as well as the conceptually opposite operation of densify by interpolating or generating random points on a given trajectory. We conclude with the important topic of similarity measurements between trajectories.</p><p>All implemented algorithms are parameterized by using the Boost Geometry's strategy mechanism that control the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and work for 3 different coordinate systems (namely, cartesian, spherical and ellipsoidal) each of which comes with its own advantages and limitations.</p>

SUMMARY:Freedom and AI: Can Free Software include ethical AI systems?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Despite the number of working groups, advisory committees, and coordination roundtables, there is little progress towards creating more ethical and safe AI systems. AI systems are deployed in increasingly fragile contexts. From law enforcement to humanitarian aid, several organizations use AI powered systems to make or inform critical decisions with increasingly outsized side effects.</p><p>What is a rights-based approach for designing minimally safe and transparent guidelines for AI systems? In this talk, we explore what a Free AI system might look like. Then, taking research and guidelines from organizations such as Google and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, we propose practical policies and tools to ensure those building an AI system respect user freedom. Lastly, we propose the outlines of a new kind of framework where all derivative works also respect those freedoms.</p>

SUMMARY:Building Blocks for Containerized Ceph
DESCRIPTION: <p>Originally, Kubernetes PersistentVolumes (PVs) could only present storage to containers as filesystems. Now, raw block PersistentVolumes (PVs) allow applications to consume storage in a new way. In particular, Rook-Ceph now makes use of them to provide the backing store for its clustered storage in a more Kubernetes-like fashion and with improved security. Now we can rethink the notion of how we structure our storage clusters, moving the focus away from static nodes and basing them on more dynamic, resilient storage devices.</p>

SUMMARY:Improving protections against speculative execution side channel
DESCRIPTION: <p>Speculative execution side channel methods pose new challenges to not only system administrators, users and security experts but also to developers. Developers can use different techniques to harden their code and reduce the feasibility of a possible malicious actor using these methods to leak secrets. But what is a secret? How can someone leak any of my data using these methods? This presentation introduces some architectural concepts that these methods use. It will also present how these methods work and how malicious actors might try to infer data from other users and codes. We will introduce some of the techniques that developers can use for mitigation, together with details about specific challenges that developers of different programming languages might face when implementing these mitigation techniques. Finally, we will present some of the mitigations that we are introducing in software to help ensure that these techniques can not be exploited in production environments.</p>

SUMMARY:RedisJSON 
DESCRIPTION: <p>Over the last decade, Redis has become one of the most popular NoSQL DBs delivering on the promise of high throughput and low latency. What started as a pure C code base is gradually being augmented with Rust due to the trifecta of safety, concurrency, and speed. A primary example is thre RedisJSON module which turns Redis into a document DB.</p><p>The talk outlines the principal architecture of the re-implementation of RedisJSON, the challenges encountered and the solutions for these. The focus is on the practical aspects rather than conveying theoretical knowledge. A comparison with other open source document DB concludes this presentation, concentrating on latency and throughput aspects.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>The presentation is going to be audiovisual and entertaining; based on a number of short videos I want to tell the story of Blender. Starting in late 90s, how Blender became open source, going over the big milestones for Blender, end ending with the fast growth of our project and the interest of the film and game industry. Blender now is a more mature project now, which involves a different dynamics than it used to be. How are we going to tackle the challenges of the industry, while not losing the community that brought us this far?</p>

SUMMARY:Dragons of CGO
DESCRIPTION: <p>YottaDB is a mature, hierarchical key-value, free / open source NoSQL database whose is used in enterprise-scale mission-critical applications in banking and healthcare, and also scales down to fit on IoT devices like the Raspberry Pi Zero, as well as applications in-between (like the University of Antwerp library catalog system). When a customer funded us to develop a Go API to YottaDB, we thought it would be a straightforward project. But it was a very painful exercise for us. The presentation discusses the problems we faced, and how we overcame them.</p>

SUMMARY:Apache DataSketches
DESCRIPTION: <p>In​ the analysis of b​ig data there are often problem queries that don’t scale because they require huge compute resources to generate exact results, or don’t parallelize well. Examples include c​ount-distinct, ​quantiles, most frequent items, joins, matrix computations, and graph analysis. Algorithms that can produce accuracy guaranteed approximate answers for these problem queries are a required toolkit for modern analysis systems that need to process massive amounts of data​ quickly. For interactive queries there may not be other viable alternatives, and in the case of real­-time streams, these specialized algorithms, called stochastic, s​treaming, sublinear algorithms,​ or 's​ketches',​ are the only known solution. This technology has helped Yahoo successfully reduce data processing times from days to hours or minutes on a number of its internal platforms and has enabled subsecond queries on real-time platforms that would have been infeasible without sketches. This talk provides a short introduction to sketching and to Apache DataSketches, an open source library of these algorithms designed for large production analysis systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Using systemd security features to build a more secure distro
DESCRIPTION: <p>Systemd provides a bunch of features which can be used to contain and secure services,making security and isolation primitives provided by the kernel accessible to system programs.This allows service authors to write much simpler code, and often to avoid any integrationwith the operating system for security purposes.Unfortunately, those features are still not widely used, possibly because developerswant to maintain compatibility with a wide range of systems.</p><p>I'll talk about the features that are the most useful,how they can be used in practice, and how this could be usedto make a noticeable change in security at the distribution level.</p>

SUMMARY:Striving for Performance Portability of Software Radio Software in the Era of Heterogeneous SoCs
DESCRIPTION: <p>Future heterogeneous DSSoCs will be extraordinarily complex in terms of processors, memory hierarchies, and interconnection networks. To manage this complexity, architects, system software designers, and application developers need design and programming technologies to be flexible, accurate, efficient, and productive. Recently, our team has started to explore the mapping of GnuRadio to various heterogeneous SoCs in order to understand how programming technologies can support this goal of making this SDR framework performance portable. Using our software stack, we are porting several SDR applications to GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and ARM, and to NVIDIA Xavier SoCs, Qualcomm Snapdragon, and Xilinx Zynq devices. Our current approach uses a directive-based programming model and a new intelligent runtime scheduler to port and execute the workflows. We are evaluating several open programming models to enable performance portability; initially, they include directive-based compilers, OpenCL, and SYCL. All of these approaches will generate tasks that are then queued and scheduled by our open-source intelligent runtime scheduler, which is a critical component of our approach. Initial performance results appear promising; however, more automation will further broad deployment. Also, we have developed a host of tools to examine and profile SDR workflows and modules. Specifically, these analysis tools enable automated characterization of the behavioral and computational features of GNU Radio blocks and workflows. The static tools in GR-tools help developers to create ontologies and queries to classify GR modules based on custom scenarios. The dynamic toolset provides automated profiling capabilities of GR workflows and presents detailed statistics on how components in a given software defined radio application perform. GR-tools also produces a graph-based representation of the analyzed data and provides powerful visualization options to filter and display the information obtained from the static and dynamic tools. Our software is available as open-source software and will be made available to the community.</p>

SUMMARY:Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research
DESCRIPTION: <p>Generating insight and conclusions from research data is often not a straightforward process. Data can be hard to find, archived in difficult to use formats, poorly structured and/or incomplete. These issues create “friction” and make it difficult to use, publish and share data. The Frictionless Data initiative (https://frictionlessdata.io/) at Open Knowledge Foundation (http://okfn.org) aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to make it effortless to transport data among different tools and platforms for further analysis, and with an emphasis on reproducible research and open data. The Frictionless Data project is comprised of a set of specifications (https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/) for data and metadata interoperability, accompanied by a collection of open source software libraries (https://frictionlessdata.io/software/) that implement these specifications, and a range of best practices for data management. Over the past year and a half, we have been working specifically with the researcher community to prototype using Frictionless Data’s open source tools to improve researchers’ data workflows and champion reproducibility. This talk will discuss the technical ideas behind Frictionless Data for research and will also showcase recent collaborative use cases, such as how oceanographers implemented Frictionless Data tooling into their data ingest pipelines to integrate disparate data while maintaining quality metadata in an easy to use interface.</p>

SUMMARY:Discover Static Code Analysis in Python with Coala Framework
DESCRIPTION: <p>We, as developer, aim to provide code that, almost matches our team code style, looks better and behaves right. Static code analysis (SCA) tools are one of the way to achieves that. But, with multi-programming languages projects and all kinds of code related needs, It's difficult to address all thoses usecases without dealing with a vast majority of SCA tools.</p><p><strong>Coala</strong> is a — language agnostic — static code analysis framework that provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code.</p><p>It is written in Python and supports way over 50 languages in addition to language independent routines. So, instead of building new analysis tools from scratch you can now build your own custom logic and let let coala deal with the rest.</p><p>This talk introduces the audience to the Coala Framework and guides them through how the can use it to build routines to do almost anything you want with your code.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Stateful applications like databases needs to preserve their state as they need to save client data of one session for use in next session in persistent storage. Managing state in Kubernetes is difficult because the system’s dynamism is too chaotic for most databases to handle. So backup of data is very important especially in case of node failures, disk failures etc.Velero is an open source tool to safely backup and restore, perform disaster recovery, and migrate Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes.In this talk, I will elaborate on why, how and when to use velero for your Kubernetes cluster and volumes.</p>

SUMMARY:Docker Security considerations & Incident Analysis 
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this presentation we take under consideration the increased use of Docker in corporate environments.It is a fact that Docker has found wide spread of use during the past years, mostly because of itbeing very easy to use , economic w.r.t resources used, fast and easy to deploy when compared witha full blown virtual machine. More and more servers are being operated as Docker hosts on whichmicro-services run in containers. From a security point of view, two aspects of it arise in thecontext of this talk and the inherent time-limitations it has. Firstly, the aspect of the alreadyquite talked-through question, “is it secure ?”.Secondly the less analyzed aspect of incident analysisand the changes introduced with respect  to known methods and evidence.In this presentation we willbriefly outline some security considerations about Docker and the average user and then we will tryto examine how Docker introduces changes to the workflow related to incident analysis and forensics in its environment.</p>

SUMMARY:DAT protocol in the browser: Progress and Challenges
DESCRIPTION: <p>Dweb protocols, like DAT and IPFS, promise significant benefits over the standard client-server protocols for web content. Particularly for self-hosting and -publishing, these protocols could reduce barriers to entry by eliminating server costs as well as promoting data ownership. Despite this, there has been no adoption of these protocols in mainstream browsers yet. This talk gives an overview of work to add native-like support for the DAT protocol to Gecko-based browsers. We discuss the limitations of the current WebExtension APIs in Chrome and Firefox for this purpose, and how Firefox's libdweb project improves on this. We present the dat-webext browser extension which implements DAT support in Firefox on Desktop and for Geckoview on Android.</p>

SUMMARY:CoffeeBeam
DESCRIPTION: <p>The speaker started to experiment with running BEAM modules on Android during summer of 2019. A prototype called CoffeeBeam has been created that is capable of loading and running BEAM files on Android. The solution also contains a virtual machine that provides a lightweight Erlang runtime system. Most of the implemented functionality is independent of the source language of the BEAM files, so the platform is easily extensible to support further languages on the BEAM. During the talk, the speaker is going to present a real-life example of running a BEAM file on Android, while presenting the concepts of the implementation and sharing the story of this journey.</p>

SUMMARY:FOSS in Animation
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Animation industry has always been ruled by proprietary software, mainly from Autodesk, Adobe and The Foundry. But recently we noticed a rise of interest in software like Blender or Krita. Alongside them, initiatives like the Academy Software Foundation are popping. Last but not least, more and more studios publish the sources of their in-house software. During this conference, we'll explain how a typical production pipeline works. Then, we'll discuss how open source impacts animation productions and what we can expect for the future. As a conclusion, I'll explain how studios collaborate more together through free and open-source software.</p>

SUMMARY:PostgreSQL on K8S at Zalando: Two years in production
DESCRIPTION: <p>Many DBAs avoid any kind of cloud offering and prefer to run their databases on dedicated hardware. At the same time companies demand to run Postgres at scale, efficiently, automated and well integrated into the infrastructure landscape. The arrival of Kubernetes provided good building blocks and an API to interact with and with it solve many problems at the infrastructure level.</p><p>The database team at Zalando started running highly-available PostgreSQL clusters on Kubernetes more than two years ago. In this talk I am going to share how we automate all routine operations, providing developers with easy-to-use tools to create, manage and monitor their databases, avoiding commercial solutions lock-in and saving costs, show open-source tools we have built to deploy and manage PostgreSQL cluster on Kubernetes by writing short manifests describing a few essential properties of the result.</p><p>Operating a few hundred PostgreSQL clusters in a containerized environment has also generated observations and learnings which we want to share: infrastructure problems (AWS), how engineers use our Postgres setup and what happens when the load becomes critical.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT Designing for Failure
DESCRIPTION: <p>Designing for Failure</p><p>While we all work very hard to build high-available, fault-tolerant andresillient applications and infrastructures the end-goal is currently oftensomething along the lines of loosly-coupled/microservices with zero-downtime inmind.Upgrades are tied to CI/CD pipelines and we should be sipping pina coladason the beach. Time to unleash the Chaos Monkey, because that is what Netflixdoes, so we should try it as well.</p><p>Now, the backend DB failed. The middleware application is returning errors, andyour frontend is showing a fancy 5xx.</p><p>While each layer is able to scale independently or fail-over to another region,even a simple timeout @ the DB can cause a cascading failure.</p><p>The application is <em>designed to work</em>, not designed to <em>recover from failure</em>.</p><p>Designing for failure applies to both software development and infrastructurearchitecture, and I'd like to talk about a couple of points to highlight thisparadigm.</p><p>Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "Introduction to Metal³" that was due to have been given by Stephen Benjamin, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend.</p>

SUMMARY:Progressive Delivery
DESCRIPTION: <p>Progressive Delivery makes it easier to adopt Continuous Delivery, by deploying new versions to a subset of users and evaluating their correctness and performance before rolling them to the totality of the users, and rolled back if not matching some key metrics. Canary deployments is one of the techniques in Progressive Delivery, used in companies like Facebook to roll out new versions gradually. But good news! you don't need to be Facebook to take advantage of it.</p><p>We will demo how to create a fully automated Progressive Delivery pipeline with Canary deployments and rollbacks in Kubernetes using Jenkins X, an open source platform for cloud native CI/CD in Kubernetes, and Flagger, a project that uses Istio and Prometheus to automate Canary rollouts and rollbacks.</p>

SUMMARY:Free at Last! The Tale of Jakarta EE
DESCRIPTION: <p>In September 2017 Oracle announced that it would be migrating governance of the Java EE platform to the Eclipse Foundation, the home of MicroProfile. Two years later Jakarta EE 8 shipped, signaling the successful completion of that move. As a result, Free Java has a new home for a significant piece of the Java ecosystem. A home which is purely open source, vendor neutral, and community led.</p><p>This talk will be about how the long and painful journey from Java EE to Jakarta EE unfolded. But more importantly it will focus on how the new Jakarta EE community works, and how there is a new, open, specification process for Java APIs (other than SE) that is available for the community. We are looking forward to welcoming many of those interested in Free Java to participate in driving new innovation in Java APIs for cloud and other exciting use cases.</p>

SUMMARY:RISC-V Boot flow: What's next ?
DESCRIPTION: <p>RISC-V boot flow has come a long way since in recent times by leveraging the various opensource boot loaders/firmware projects. This also helped in achieving a well-supported and standard boot flow for RISC-V. As a result, developers can use the same boot loaders to boot Linux on RISC-V as they do in other architectures. Currently, U-Boot is used as the last stage boot loader and OpenSBI as the machine mode run time service provider, but there's more work to be done. A few of such future works includes U-boot SPL support, UEFI boot in RISC-V Linux and booting protocol improvements. This talk will focus on some of these ongoing works which are necessary to declare that RISC-V is truly ready for world domination.</p>

SUMMARY:Secret History of Prometheus Histograms
DESCRIPTION: <p>Representing distributions in a metrics-based monitoring system is both important and hard. Doing it right unlocks many powerful use cases that would otherwise require expensive event processing. Prometheus offers the somewhat weirdly named Histogram and Summary metric types for distributions. How have they become what they are today with all their weal and woe? To help understand the present, let's shed light on the past. Studying this piece of Prometheus's history will also allow a glimpse of the bigger picture, why certain things are the way they are in Prometheus, and which parts of the original vision are still awaiting fulfillment.</p>

SUMMARY:Facilitating distributed deterministic computation with WASI
DESCRIPTION: <p>WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is the new brilliant community effort at standardising the use of WebAssembly (Wasm) outside the browser environment. Initiated by Mozilla, now under the umbrella of Bytecode Alliance, WASI has the potential to revolutionise the way we think about the "build once, run anywhere" in a truly secure manner. But could WASI also lend itself to a task of running any code within a network of distributed, untrusted nodes such as BOINC or Golem Network, and ensuring that the results received are indeed correct? The short answer is yes, if determinism of computations could be enforced which opens many ways at verifying the results. Enforcing determinism is a rather difficult thing to achieve in other platforms such as JVM etc., now possible thanks to Wasm and WASI. This talk will delve deep into the inner workings of the WASI spec, and its goto implementation, the wasi-common library, and explore how and if determinism can be enforced at the WASI syscall level.</p>

SUMMARY:MobilityDB
DESCRIPTION: <p>MobilityDB is an open source moving object database system (https://github.com/ULB-CoDE-WIT/MobilityDB). Its core function is to efficiently store and query mobility tracks, such as vehicle GPS trajectories. It is engineered up from PostgreSQL and PostGIS, providing spatiotemporal data management via SQL. It integrates with the postgreSQL eco-system allowing for complex architectures such as mobility stream processing and cloud deployments.</p><p>The presentation will explain the architecture of MobilityDB, its database types, indexes, and operations. An end to end example will be demonstrated, starting with data preparation, loading, transformation, querying, until visualization. This presentation will be of special interest to the PostgreSQL community, and to professionals in the transportation domain.</p><p>This presentation will build on our talks in PGConf.ru 2019, and FOSS4G Belgium 2019.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>While actual browsers expose their internals through an API and limit access to the host system, Next doesn't, allowing for infinite extensibility and inviting the users to program their web browser. On top of that, it doesn't tie itself to a particular platform (we currently provide bindings to WebKit and WebEngine) and allows for live code reloads, thanks to the Common Lisp language, about which we'll share our experience too.</p>

SUMMARY:Supervising and emulating syscalls
DESCRIPTION: <p>Recently the kernel landed seccomp support for SECCOMP<em>RET</em>USER_NOTIF which enables a process (supervisee) to retrieve a fd for its seccomp filter. This fd can then be handed to another (usually more privileged) process (supervisor). The supervisor will then be able to receive seccomp messages about the syscalls having been performed by the supervisee.</p><p>We have integrated this feature into userspace and currently make heavy use of this to intercept mknod(), mount(), and other syscalls in user namespaces aka in containers.For example, if the mknod() syscall matches a device in a pre-determined whitelist the privileged supervisor will perform the mknod syscall in lieu of the unprivileged supervisee and report back to the supervisee on the success or failure of its attempt. If the syscall does not match a device in a whitelist we simply report an error.</p><p>This talk is going to show how this works and what limitations we run into and what future improvements we plan on doing in the kernel.</p>

SUMMARY:Oreboot
DESCRIPTION: <p>Oreboot = Coreboot - C. Oreboot is a fully open-source power-on-reset and romstage firmware written in Rust. Oreboot can boot a HiFive RISC-V processor to Linux with a Go user-mode.</p><p>Oreboot rethinks the firmware driver models. Each driver is distilled to four basic functions: init, pread, pwrite and shutdown. This interface allows us to make convenient higher-level drivers such as a "union driver" which duplicates a single write operation to multiple drivers. This makes consoles which have multiple underlying UART drivers elegant.</p><p>By using the Rust programming language, Oreboot has a leg-up in terms of security and reliability compared to contemporary firmware written in C or assembly. Rust's borrow-checker ensures pointers are not used after freed and proves that coroutines are thread-safe at compile time.</p><p>In this talk, we will also present a short overview of the basics of Rust, how our driver model incorporates coroutines and the bootflow of Oreboot.</p>

SUMMARY:Advanced debugging techniques of Go code
DESCRIPTION: <p>In an ideal world, you would write Go code, compile it, and then it would work perfectly the first time. But unfortunately it doesn't work in this manner. There are many different books and articles about how to write good code in go, but not so many how to debug code efficiently. In my talk I'll try to cover such important topic.Go is a new programming language with best tools for development. In my talk I'll cover how to efficiently using these tools to debug your code. I’ll start from history of debuggers, later I'll show you how to debug go itself, if you need to find bug in language. Than I can demonstrate  how to effectively debug microservices using docker and k8s, what’s remote debugging and how to apply it to application which already has been deployed. Debugging unit tests and not only code. Some tricks of debugging command line applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Wikibase Ecosystem
DESCRIPTION: <p>Wikidata, Wikimedia's knowledge base, has been very successful since its inception 7 years ago. Wikidata's general purpose data about the world is powering everything from Wikipedia to your digital personal assistant. Its linked, machine readable data is collected and maintained by a community of over 20000 people. But not all data should and can be in Wikidata. Instead we are taking the software powering Wikidata, Wikibase, to new places. We empower communities and institutions all around the world who want to collect structured, machine-readable data about a topic area of their choice to run their own Wikibase. These Wikibase instances are then connected to form a thriving ecosystem. In this talk we'll go over what Wikibase is, where it's coming from and what it is enabling right now.</p>

SUMMARY:COLLAB: The optics of the policy
DESCRIPTION: <p>Photography policies have begun to appear at free-software events in recent years. These policies typically seek to address personal privacy concerns for event attendees, but they sometimes conflict with the event's desire to record talks, Q&amp;A periods, and social gatherings in public spaces. If not drafted with care, photo policies also run the risk of creating ambiguities for journalists, other attendees making personal photo or video recordings, and members of event-hosting organizations or the public. This session will be an open discussion about photo and video-recording policies, online tagging policies, and related personal-privacy policies, with the goal of clarifying the requirements, needs, and intents of all stakeholders in the FOSS community, so that future event organizers have a solid framework from which to draft clear policies that fit their situations.</p>

SUMMARY:When Python meets GraphQL: Managing contributors identities in your open source project
DESCRIPTION: <p>SortingHat is an open source Python tool that helps to manage the different contributor identities within an open source project. Under the hood SortingHat relies on a relational database, which can be queried via SQL, command line or directly via its Python interface. However, these ways of interacting with SortingHat hinder its integration with external tools, web interfaces and new web technologies (e.g., Django, REST services). To overcome these obstacles, we have evolved SortingHat's architecture using a GraphQL model based on the Graphene-Django implementation.</p><p>This talk describes our experience in migrating to GraphQL, from adapting the SortingHat functionalities to refactoring the unit tests. Furthermore, we comment also on lesson learned, advantages and drawbacks of using this new approach</p><p>SortingHat is one of the core tools of GrimoireLab, an open-source software analytics platform part of CHAOSS project (Community Health Analytics Open Source Software) under the umbrella of the Linux Foundation.</p>

SUMMARY:Edge Clouds with OpenNebula
DESCRIPTION: <p>Edge computing is currently getting a lot of traction thanks to the growing availability of rented computing resources around the world. The idea is based on moving the core computational logic and storage to distant locations that are closer to the entities they interact with (e.g. users or sensors). The benefits come from improving network latencies, increasing user experience with the provided service, and lowering the transfers to the central locations. Edge clouds bring the flexibility and proven workflows of cloud computing to the edge.</p><p>OpenNebula is an open source framework to build private and hybrid clouds based on KVM, LXD, and/or VMware vCenter. While the main domain is the corporate private on-premises cloud, it comes with simple and extensible tooling ("oneprovision") for automated deployment of edge clouds. When provided with a deployment descriptor, it allocates the physical hosts on the public bare-metal cloud provider, configures all necessary services (e.g. install libvirt/KVM or LXD), and enables them for use in OpenNebula. The process is as simple as running a command-line tool and the cloud administrator gets a fully usable configured edge cluster in a few  minutes.</p><p>As part of a usability validation exercise, we successfully deployed public gaming servers from scratch to running services on 17 different locations worldwide in just 25 minutes: https://opennebula.org/opennebula-a-lightning-fast-video-gaming-edge-use-case-2 .</p><p>This talk introduces the OpenNebula "edge" concept and shows the current state, capabilities, and limitations of edge cloud deployment tooling. It explores the difficulties of running the IaaS-in-IaaS cloud and demonstrates with practical examples the use of tooling and management of edge deployments.</p>

SUMMARY:Ephemeral Environments For Developers In Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION: <p>A key aspect of a microservice architecture is to make sure individual services work in isolation. But as a developer its also important to make sure the service works in the full system. Providing developers a way to run pre-production code in a multi-service environment is challenging.</p><p>Making use of existing Helm charts and defaulting to production configuration does part of the work. Also important is being able to extend upon tools like Telepresence/Ksync for debugging in k8s. But while these great tools are available, what has been lacking is the "easy to use", single command that gives a developer a place to work with their own full, self-contained system. There are now a few open source solutions to do just that (like Garden, Acyl, &amp; Armador). In this talk, Jeff will break down how these tools work, and what makes them different.</p>

SUMMARY:Incrementality and deck functions
DESCRIPTION: <p>Protocols in symmetric cryptography are often built from block ciphers, with a fixed input and output size, while variable sizes are handled through their modes of use. Incrementality, namely, the ability to efficiently compute the output for increasing inputs, or to request longer outputs, is often a property of the implementation rather than an explicit feature of a mode.</p><p>A doubly-extendable cryptographic keyed (or deck) function is a new kind of object that makes incrementality an integral part of its definition. Writing modes for various applications, such as authenticated encryption of a network channel or disk encryption with a wide block cipher, on top of a deck function turns out to be a simple exercise and leads to less error-prone implementations than on top of a block cipher. We illustrate this with the session-supporting authenticated encryption modes SANE and SANSE. (Sessions naturally protect a continuous flow of messages or a client-server dialog.)</p><p>While a deck function can be constructed from existing primitives, like a block cipher, we show two more natural ways of making a deck function in practice.</p><ul><li><p>The first one is based on the well-known permutation-based duplex construction, of which a nice instantiation is the <a href="https://strobe.sourceforge.io/">Strobe protocol framework</a>. Strobe was showcased in <a href="https://www.discocrypto.com/">Noise+Strobe=Disco</a> as an advantageous replacement to all kinds of primitives in the <a href="https://noiseprotocol.org/">Noise protocol framework</a>, resulting in <a href="https://permutationbasedcrypto.org/2018/slides/David_Wong.pdf">much simpler specifications and a lighter implementation</a>. Xoodyak, our candidate to the NIST Lightweight Cryptography competition, is another example.</p></li><li><p>The second one is based on the recent Farfalle construction, which relies on the parallel application of a permutation. Farfalle's inherent parallelism yields deck functions that are at the same time simple and efficient on a wide range of platforms. In particular, we point out the nice performance of Kravatte and Xoofff, two deck functions based on the Keccak-p and the Xoodoo permutation, respectively. It is worth noting that Kravatte and Xoofff are much faster than AES-128 in software, and at least competitive with and often faster than AES-128 using dedicated AES instructions <a href="https://keccak.team/sw_performance.html">on the more recent Intel and AMD processors</a>!</p></li></ul>

SUMMARY:An Introduction to the Tor Ecosystem for Developers
DESCRIPTION: <p>Tor is a free and open-source software anonymization system that allows people around the world to use the internet safely. The Tor network itself is operated by various volunteering individuals and organizations around the globe, and the network carries around 200 Gbit/s of traffic and helps somewhere between 2,000,000 and 8,000,000 users every day. The Tor ecosystem is much larger than the anonymity system that Tor provides itself: The Tor Project, the non-profit behind the anonymity system, also develops and maintains a web browser based on Mozilla Firefox. The organization also does monitoring of the network, work on emerging anti-censorship technology, work with translators, and downstream distributions that do packaging in free software operating system distributions.</p><p>In this presentation, we will have a look at what it takes to develop and maintain an anonymity system like Tor and the various other components in the Tor ecosystem. We will look at what The Tor Project has been up to lately, primarily with a focus on core Tor itself. However, we will also have a look at some of our recent developments with anti-censorship technology. Finally, we will have a look at how the participant can contribute to the Tor project.</p><p>No prior knowledge of Tor is necessary to participate.</p>

SUMMARY:Using biometric gadgets for express-tests in the UX/UI research
DESCRIPTION: <p>Estimating the user’s physical and mental state with a set of special measuring devices can be helpful in detecting bottlenecks of the human-computer interaction. Until recent years, evaluating cognitive and physical load by biometrical parameters (heart rate, galvanic skin response, brain waves, gaze direction, etc.) was too expensive to be widely adopted for FLOSS. However contemporary consumer-grade gadgets targeted at fitness and entertainment are much more affordable and precise enough to be used in the UX/UI comparison. Still, their different primary goal often complicates their usage for the  research.  The talk will highlight which devices are the most suitable ones for the research purposes in the open-source world (the ones having open-source and GNU/Linux frameworks to access biometric data).  Gadgets covered with the talk are fitness-trackers, EEG headsets, and eye-trackers. Patterns of getting data, problems with cyphering and licensing will be discussed, as well as brief biometry usage scenarios and examples of the UI express-testing.</p>

SUMMARY:Cooperative Perception in Future Cars using GNU Radio
DESCRIPTION: <p>Title: Cooperative Perception in Future Cars using GNU Radio</p><p>Speaker: Augusto Vega, IBM Research (NY, USA)</p><p>Abstract:The phenomenon of self-driving (autonomous) vehicles is a symbol of the grand re-emergence of artificial intelligence and robotics as a promising technology. The most general model of future vehicular transportation is that of artificially intelligent, connected, autonomous vehicles (CAVs) [1].</p><p>In this talk, we present a representative open-source application for CAVs operating as a collaborative swarm and communicating via GNU Radio. The application, called ERA [2], incorporates local sensing, creation of occupancy grid maps, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication of grid maps between neighboring vehicles using GNU Radio-based dedicated short-range communication (DSRC), and map fusion to create a joint higher-accuracy grid map [3]. Specifically, each vehicle in ERA uses its onboard sensors to generate local occupancy grid maps, which it communicates to other nearby vehicles using DSRC. When a vehicle receives occupancy maps from nearby cars, it merges the received ones with the locally-generated occupancy maps, expanding the scope and increasing the accuracy of this vehicle's perception. The DSRC transceiver adopted in ERA is an open-source GNU Radio implementation of the IEEE 802.11p standard by Bastian Bloessl [4]; while perception and map creation is implemented using ROS (Robot Operating System) [5]. We created an appropriate software interface between GNU Radio and ROS which enables proper execution and interaction of both frameworks.</p><p>In addition to presenting a deep dive into ERA's code, we will also show performance analysis results of ERA (including its GNU Radio components) and discuss potential acceleration opportunities for performance and efficiency improvement -- including optimizations of Viterbi decoding and complex exponential through hardware acceleration. We believe that ERA can help to fill the gap between the fast-growing CAV R&amp;D domain and GNU Radio, specifically when it comes to the wireless communication aspect of future vehicles.</p><p>[1] A.

SUMMARY:SELinux fun with MySQL and friends
DESCRIPTION: <p>SELinux (Security Enhanced Linux) provides enhanced security mechanism for more advanced access control and auditing. It allows your application software and your system users to only access the resources it's been preconfigured to allow. Of course when you want to move your data- or log files to a non-standard location these policies will stop MySQL from starting.</p><p>The easy way out is obviously to set SELinux to disabled or permissive. But someone once said: "Every time you disable SELinux a kitten dies". We'll show you a few ways how you can find out if it actually is SELinux that is blocking you and how to update the policies to properly keep you system secured.</p>

SUMMARY:Projectional Editing and Its Implications
DESCRIPTION: <p>Let’s shake some of the dogmas that constrain our programming worldview. In this session, I would like to take you to an alternative world - a world where programming languages are not parsed, a world where languages can be downloaded from the Internet and plugged easily into your IDE. A world where you have the power to customize the languages that you use. You’ll see that projectional editing in JetBrains MPS gives you incredible freedom in how you express your thoughts. It allows you to choose notations that best fit the task at hand. Your code can be edited as text, tables, diagrams, a form, or a combination of those. This is especially useful for Domain-specific languages and we’ll see real-life examples from domains such as the insurance industry, embedded software development, bioinformatics, enterprise systems and legislation. We’ll also discuss the downsides and integration challenges that projectional editors face. My goal is that you’ll leave this session inspired, enriched and motivated to try something new.</p>

SUMMARY:strace --seccomp-bpf: a look under the hood
DESCRIPTION: <p>strace is known to add significant overhead to any application it traces.Even when users are interested in a handful of syscalls, strace will bydefault intercept all syscalls made by the observed processes, involvingseveral context switches per syscall.  Since strace v5.3, the<code>--seccomp-bpf</code> option allows reducing this overhead, by stopping observedprocesses only at syscalls of interest.  This option relies on seccomp-bpfand inherits a few of its limitations.</p><p>In this talk, we will describe the default behavior of ptrace and strace,to understand the problem <code>--seccomp-bpf</code> addresses.  We will then detailthe inner workings of the new option, as seen from ptrace (seccomp-stops)and bpf (syscall matching algorithms).  Finally, we'll discuss limitationsof the new option and avenues for improvement.</p>

How do CRI-O and containerd overlap ? Does Kata containers compete with Firecracker ? Is there any relationship between OCI and CRI ? How many different meanings can "container runtime" have ?</p><p>In this talk, we will navigate this treacherous sea of overlapping technologies and acronyms that take care of running container workloads, below Kubernetes all the way down to the Linux kernel. We will present at a high-level how these technologies, interfaces and levels of abstraction combine and overlap, and hopefully clarify which are spec vs. implementation, which are complementary, and which are alternative solutions.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Geo-spatial queries on multi-petabyte weather data archivesJohn Hanley, Nicolau Manubens, Tiago Quintino, James Hawkes, Emanuele Danovaro</p><p>Weather forecasts produced by ECMWF and environment services by the Copernicus programme act as a vital input for many downstream simulations and applications. A variety of products, such as ECMWF reanalyses and archived forecasts, are additionally available to users via the MARS archive and the Copernicus data portal. Transferring, storing and locally modifying large volumes of such data prior to integration currently presents a significant challenge to users. The key aim for ECMWF effort in H2020 Lexis project is to provide tools for data query and pre-processing close to data archives, facilitating fast and seamless application integration by enabling precise and efficient data delivery to the end-user.</p><p>ECMWF aims to implement a set of services to efficiently select, retrieve and pre-process meteorological multi-dimensional data by allowing multi-dimensional queries including spatio-temporal and domain-specific constraints. Those services are exploited by Lexis partners to design complex workflows to mitigate the effect of natural hazards and investigate the water-food-energy nexus.</p><p>This talk will give a general overview of Lexis project and its main aims and objectives. It will present the pilot applications exploiting ECMWF data as the main driver of complex workflows on HPC and cloud computing resources. In particular, it will focus on how ECMWF's data services will provide geospatial queries on multi-dimensional peta-scale datasets and how this will improve overall workflow performance and enable access to new data for the pilot users.</p><p>This work is supported by the Lexis project and has been partly funded by the European Commission's ICT activity of the H2020 Programme under grant agreement number: 825532.</p>

SUMMARY:Stylo : a user friendly text editor for humanities scholars
DESCRIPTION: <p>As an editor for WYSIWYM text, Stylo is designed to change the entire digital editorial chain of scholarly journals the field of human sciences.</p><p>Stylo (https://stylo.ecrituresnumeriques.ca) is designed to simplify the writing and editing of scientific articles in the humanities and social sciences. It is intended for authors and publishers engaged in high quality scientific publishing. Although the structuring of documents is fundamental for digital distribution, this aspect is currently delayed until the end of the editorial process. This task should, however, be undertaken early on in the process; it must be considered by the author himself. The philosophy behind Stylo consists in returning the task of managing the publication markup to researchers. This repositioning of tasks relating to the editorial process relies on the author’s semantic rather than graphic skills.</p><p>This lightning talk will be the opportunity to present this tool and several publishing projects realized with Stylo.</p>

SUMMARY:Explicitly Supporting Stretch Clusters in Ceph
DESCRIPTION: <p>Ceph is an open source distributed object store, network block device, and file system designed for reliability, performance, and scalability. While Ceph is designed for use in a single data center, users have deployed “stretch” clusters across multiple data centers for many years, and deploying Ceph to back Red Hat’s OpenShift Container Storage product required us to support that workload explicitly and well — in particular, in the face of netsplits.This requires improvements to our “monitor” leader elections and to the “OSD” peering process to keep data available without breaking our data integrity guarantees. This talk presents the whole cycle of that work from an algorithm and programmer perspective: the dangers we identified, the changes we needed, the architecture changes to support faster test iteration and coding, and the results.</p>

SUMMARY:A Practical CI/CD Framework for Machine Learning at Massive Scale
DESCRIPTION: <p>Managing production machine learning systems at scale has uncovered new challenges that have required fundamentally different approaches to that of traditional software engineering and data science. In this talk, we'll provide key insights on MLOps, which often encompasses the concepts around monitoring, deployment, orchestration and continuous delivery for machine learning. We will be covering a hands on an example where we will be training, deploying and monitoring ML at scale.  We'll be using Jenkins X (+ Prow &amp; Tekton) to deploy/promote these models across multiple environments. We will use KIND (Kubernetes in Docker) to run integration tests in our development environment. Finally, we'll be using Seldon to orchestrate &amp; monitor these models leveraging advanced ML techniques.</p>

SUMMARY:LLVM meets Code Property Graphs
DESCRIPTION: <p>The security of computer systems fundamentally depends on the quality of its underlying software. Despite a long series of research in academia and industry, security vulnerabilities regularly manifest in program code. Consequently, they remain one of the primary causes of security breaches today.The discovery of software vulnerabilities is a classic yet challenging problem of the security domain. In the last decade, there appeared several production-graded solutions with a favorable outcome.</p><p>Code Property Graph[1] (or CPG) is one such solution. CPG is a representation of a program that combines properties of abstract syntax trees, control flow graphs, and program dependence graphs in a joint data structure.There exist two counterparts[2][3] that allow traversals over code property graphs in order to find vulnerabilities and to extract any other interesting properties.</p><p>In this talk, we want to cover the following topics:</p><ul><li>an intro to the code property graphs</li><li>how we built llvm2cpg, a tool that converts LLVM Bitcode to the CPG representation</li><li>how we teach the tool to reason about properties of high-level languages (C/C++/ObjC) based on the low-level representation only</li><li>interesting findings and some results</li></ul><p>[1] https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6956589[2] https://github.com/ShiftLeftSecurity/codepropertygraph[3] https://ocular.shiftleft.io</p>

SUMMARY:Are You Testing Your Observability? Patterns for Instrumenting Your Services
DESCRIPTION: <p>Observability is the key to understand how your application runs and behaves in action. This is especially true for distributed environments like Kubernetes, where users run Cloud-Native microservices.</p><p>Among many other observability signals like logs and traces, the metrics signal has a substantial role. Sampled measurements observed throughout the system are crucial for monitoring the health of the applications and, they enable real-time, actionable alerting. While there are many open-source robust libraries, in various languages, that allow us to easily instrument services for backends like Prometheus, there are still numerous possibilities to make a mistake or misuse those tools.</p><p>During this talk, two engineers from Red Hat: Kemal and Bartek (Prometheus and Thanos project maintainer) will discuss valuable patterns and best practices for instrumenting your application. The speakers will go through common pitfalls and failure cases while sharing valuable insights and methods to avoid those mistakes. In addition, this talk will demonstrate, how to leverage unit testing to verify the correctness of your observability signals. How it helps and why it is important. Last but not least, the talk will cover a demo of the example instrumented application based on the experience and projects we maintain.</p><p>The audience will leave knowing how to answer the following important questions:</p><p>What are the essential metrics that services should have?Should you test your observability? What are the ways to test it on a unit-test level?What are the common mistakes while instrumenting services and how to avoid them?</p><p>And more!</p>

SUMMARY:Auto-healing cluster through negative testing
DESCRIPTION: <p>OCS stands for Openshift Container storage. It provides container-based storage for OCP(Openshift container platform). It’s easily scalable to bare metal, VMs and cloud platforms.Auto healing is a property of OCS cluster that auto heals a cluster component automatically when passes through an unexpected condition. A component can be a node, a network interface, a service, etc. To make sure auto heals just fine, we introduced negative testing.Negative Testing is defined as, a testing type that checks a system for unexpected conditions. In this presentation, We’re going to talk, what role negative testing plays, how to negative test components like node by shutting it down, deploying a heavy workload, etc. Similarly, for the network component, we are going to see what happens when the public network is disconnected along with many more scenarios.</p>

SUMMARY:The Hidden Early History of Unix
DESCRIPTION: <p>The early history of Unix is much richer than is usually presented. There are many hidden gems that are little known and quite interesting to learn about. The dates of many of the "firsts" for Unix accomplishments is much earlier than people think. This well-researched talk explores those gems, firsts and shares many artifacts from the early days of Unix. Many of these artifacts have just come to light in recent years, and change how we view the early history of Unix. Even the oldest of grey beards will learn things they didn't know about Unix from this talk.</p>

SUMMARY:SaBRe: Load-time selective binary rewriting
DESCRIPTION: <h2>Abstract</h2><p>Binary rewriting is a technique that consists in disassembling a program to modify its instructions, withmany applications, e.g. monitoring, debugging, reverse engineering and reliability. However, existing solutions suffer from well-knownshortcomings in terms of soundness, performance and usability.</p><p>We present <em>SaBRe</em>, a novel load-time framework for selective binary rewriting. SaBRe rewrites specific constructs ofinterest — mainly system calls and function prologues — when the program is loaded into memory. This enables users to intercept those constructs at runtimevia a modular architecture allowing custom plugins to be linked with SaBRe using a simple and flexibleAPI. We also discuss the theoretical underpinnings of disassembling and rewriting, including conditions forcoverage, accuracy, and correctness; and how they affect SaBRe.</p><p>We developed two backends for SaBRe — one for x86_64 and one for RISC-V — which were in turn used toimplement two open-source plugins: a fast system call tracer and a fault injector. Our evaluationshows that SaBRe imposes little performance overhead, between 0.2% and 4.3% on average.In addition to explaining the architecture of SaBRe and demonstrating its performance,we also show on a concrete example how easy creating a new plugin for SaBRe is.</p><p>SaBRe is a free open-source software released under the GPLv3 licenseand originally developed as part of the Software Reliabilty Group at Imperial College London.</p>

SUMMARY:How Containers and Kubernetes re-defined the GNU/Linux Operating System
DESCRIPTION: <p>Free Software (as in Freedom) had won. The vertically integrated Cloud now is the predominant operational paradigm and is threatening to undermine software freedom. To many all seems lost, but the world keeps changing and decentralized compute is making a comeback. Containers and Kubernetes are already having a deep impact on the Linux operating system (OS) that goes well beyond DevOps and cloud-native applications. The concepts of application-centric packaging, process isolation through Linux containers, and immutable infrastructure are shaking up the core traditions of today's GNU/Linux operating systems. These concepts are also challenging the assumptions and approaches derived from the past 40+ years of work that originated with UNIX. The Linux distribution as we know it is coming to an end, and is being replaced by a new concept of containerized, multi-instance, multi-user applications, which can be deployed in scale-out environments as well as for widely distributed compute scenarios. In this session, we'll assess this new OS environment in the times of '5G' de-centralized cloud and take a deep look at the consequences this new OS model has for both developers and admins.</p>

SUMMARY:Self-hosted server backups for the paranoid
DESCRIPTION: <p><a href="https://quarkslab.com/en/">Quarkslab</a> is a French company specializing in information security R&amp;D, consulting and software development.</p><p>Due to strong data security constraints imposing self-hosted solutions coupled with limited resources in a fast-growth environment, data safety has been a pain point in our infrastructure.</p><p>After our backup server failed, we decided to recreate a new backup system from scratch, adapted to our needs and using technologies we were familiar with, to backup 30+ Linux servers.</p><hr /><p>In this talk, we will present how our old backup system failed, the key requirements we learned from this failure, and how we designed and implemented a new backup system based on <a href="https://borgbackup.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Borg Backup</a>, <a href="https://github.com/witten/borgmatic">borgmatic</a>, SSH, Python and <a href="https://www.freenas.org/">FreeNAS</a> to solve those requirements.</p><p>We will conclude by listing the shortcomings and improvement points of our approach, as well as comparing our solution to seven important properties every backup system should have.</p><hr /><p>Some interesting features of our new backup solution are strong data safety and security, fully self-hosted, using only open-source tools, simple to set up and easy to understand.</p><p>One specific requirement we solved was for the sysadmin team to be blind to the data they backup, managing only the process itself.</p><p>This lets people working on confidential project on dedicated and access-restricted servers to still use a centralized and resilient backup system without compromising data and server security.</p><hr /><p>We will open-source our Ansible roles and Python scripts on <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab">Github</a> before FOSDEM.</p>

SUMMARY:How Transparent Data Encryption is built in MySQL and Percona Server ?
DESCRIPTION: <p>How Transparent Data Encryption is built in MySQL and Percona Server ?- keyrings – what are they used for ? What is the difference between using a server back-end (keyring<em>vault) versus file back-end (keyring</em>file). How it affects server startup and why? Why per server separation is needed in Vault Server?- How Master Key encryption works ? How it is build on page level ? How do we know which key we should fetch to decrypt a table ? How do we know that used key is the correct one ? How do we make sure that we can decrypt a table when we need it ?- What crypto algorithms are used ?- How Master Key rotation works ? Why is it needed ?- What is KEYRING encryption and what are encryption threads?- How binlog encryption works in 5.7 and how it works in 8.0 ?- How undo log/redo log encryption works ?</p>

SUMMARY:GraphBLAS: A linear algebraic approach for high-performance graph algorithms
DESCRIPTION: <p>There is increasing interest to apply graph analytical techniques to a wide array of problems, many operating on large-scale graphs with billions of edges. While graph algorithms and their complexity is textbook material, efficient implementation of such algorithms is still a major challenge due to a number of reasons. First, the irregular and unstructured nature of graphs leads to a massive amount of random data access, which makes it difficult to use typical caching and parallelization techniques. Second, to optimize their code, developers need to be aware of the nuances of the underlying hardware which, at the very least consists of multiple CPU cores but often also incorporates heterogeneous components such as GPUs or even FPGAs. During the last decade, a number of graph programming models (such as Google's Pregel) have been proposed but most of these focused defining high-level abstractions for distributed execution environments and introduced a significant runtime overhead.</p><p>A potential approach for defining efficient graph processing algorithms is to exploit the well-known duality of graphs and sparse adjacency matrices, using matrix operations to capture algorithms. Surprisingly, only a few recent research prototypes have used this model with little consensus on the set of necessary building blocks. The GraphBLAS initiative (launched in 2013) aims to define a standard to capture graph algorithms in the language of linear algebra - following the footsteps of the BLAS standard which, starting four decades ago, revolutionized scientific computing by defining constructs on dense matrices.</p><p>In this talk, I give an overview of the GraphBLAS standard and its key components. First, I illustrate how matrix operations on various semirings correspond to the steps in graph algorithms. I then use these operations to present fundamental graph algorithms such as breadth-first search, shortest paths, and the clustering coefficient. Finally, I demonstrate the scalability of the GraphBLAS-based algorithms with the LDBC Graphalytics benchmark. The presented implementations are available open-source as part of LAGraph, a library built on top of GraphBLAS to demonstrate how to design efficient algorithms in linear algebra.</p>

SUMMARY:Follow Your Celery Tasks
DESCRIPTION: <p>All Python developer who want to run asynchronous tasks should know Celery. If you have already used it, you know how great it is ! But you also discovered how it can be complicated to follow the state of a complex workflow. Celery Director is a tool  we created at OVH to fix this problem : using some concepts of Event Sourcing, Celery Director helps us to follow the whole lifecycle of our workflows. It allows us to check when a problem occurred and relaunch the whole DAG (or just a subpart if tasks are not completely idempotent). During this talk we will introduce you the different concepts of Celery Director then we'll make a demonstration of it.</p>

SUMMARY:Kubernetes of Things
DESCRIPTION: <p>Kubernetes allows to extend its API surface with custom objects called CustomResources (CR) whose JSON contents is described via OpenAPI schemas. The REST API allows realtime notification of changes sent out to multiple listeners. This sounds like the ingredients necessary to build an open IoT platform. This talk is about using CustomResources for Kubernetes as Things, i.e. namespaced objects representing sensors and actors. It is based on a case-study implementing this idea following an example of a deep sea station with valves and pumps, a controller controlling the air pressure in the station.</p>

SUMMARY:A Brief Survey through Genode's ARMv8 Playground
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Genode project has evolved over the past decade into a versatile toolkit for general-purpose computing. Even though support for ARM embedded devices is an inherent part of it since the very beginning, the focus of the past years was more x86-Architecture centered. Sculpt, the desktop incarnation of Genode, being the prime example. Recently, Genode's ARMv8 port ignited extensive development efforts to support more sophisticated workloads on top of modern embedded and mobile devices.</p><p>The talk provides an overview about the current ARMv8 Genode landscape, its ambitions and potential. It will live demonstrate recent achievements from device support up to hardware-assisted virtualization on top of the NXP i.MX8 SoC.</p>

SUMMARY:An ultimate guide to upgrading your PostgreSQL installation
DESCRIPTION: <p>Even an experienced PostgreSQL DBA can not always say that upgrading between major versions of Postgres is an easy task, especially if there are some special requirements, such as downtime limitations or if something goes wrong. For less experienced DBAs anything more complex than dump/restore can be frustrating.</p><p>In this talk I will describe why we need a special procedure to upgrade between major versions, how that can be achieved and what sort of problems can occur. I will review all possible ways to upgrade your cluster from classical pg_upgrade to old-school slony or modern methods like logical replication. For all approaches, I will give a brief explanation how it works (limited by the scope of this talk of course), examples how to perform upgrade and some advice on potentially problematic steps. Besides I will touch upon such topics as integration of upgrade tools and procedures with other software — connection brokers, operating system package managers, automation tools, etc. This talk would not be complete if I do not cover cases when something goes wrong and how to deal with such cases.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>According to the interwebs, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in the multiverse.<br/>And yet, when it comes to games, its popularity seems to dwindle.</p><p>Why though...<br/>Is it really not suited for game development?<br/>Is the language as bad as the critics claim??<br/>Is GC...EVIL!?</p><p>I have this side-project of porting Doom 3 from C/C++ to Java. And even though Doom 3 is a ~15 year old game, it is still a massive AAA code-base. So I believe my experiences there can adequately answer a lot of the questions that come to mind when you think of Java &amp; Games.</p><p>During this talk, I will try to convince you that Java is a very viable game prototyping/development tool.<br/>Either that, or will add more fuel to the flame...</p>

SUMMARY:The Different Ways of Minimizing ANY
DESCRIPTION: <p>The DNS Protocol has features that have grown to become liabilities.  The query type "ANY" is one.  Earlier this year a published RFC document describes how a DNS server may respond to such queries while reducing the liability.  But the document does not define a definitive means for a server to signal that it is differing from the original protocol.  This presentation measures of the impact of having no definitive means specified and examines the "fear, uncertainty, and doubt" of lacking explicit signals.</p>

SUMMARY:Linux memory management at scale
DESCRIPTION: <p>Memory management is an extraordinarily complex and widely misunderstood topic. It is also one of the most fundamental concepts to understand in order to produce coherent, stable, and efficient systems and containers, especially at scale. In this talk, we will go over how to compose reliable memory heavy, multi container systems that can withstand production incidents, and go over examples of how Facebook is achieving this in production at the cutting edge. We'll also go over the open-source technologies we're building to make this work at scale in a density that has never been achieved before.</p><p>We will go over widely-misunderstood Linux memory management concepts which are important to site reliability and container management with an engineer who works on the Linux kernel's memory subsystem, busting commonly held misconceptions about things like swap and memory constraints, and giving advice on key and bleeding-edge kernel concepts like PSI, cgroup v2, memory protection, and other important container-related topics along the way.</p>

SUMMARY:Rethinking kubernetes networking with SRv6 and Contiv-VPP
DESCRIPTION: <p>Kubernetes (k8s) is currently the de-facto standard for containers orchestration. However, K8s does not provide any solution for handling containers networking. Instead, it offloads the networking to third-party certified plugins called CNI plugins. Contiv-VPP is a k8s CNI plugin that offers fast I/O by leveraging the carrier-grade capabilities of VPP and DPDK in the dataplane.</p><p>The adoption of containers and microservices calls for IPv6 to provide addressing and reachability for such massive number of endpoints. SRv6 leverages the IPv6 dataplane to provide overlay networking, traffic engineering, load balancing, network policy and service chaining.</p><p>In this talk, we present an SRv6-based solution for k8s networking. We will show how SRv6 is used for pod-to-pod communication, k8s services and service function chaining (SFC), and how SRv6 solves several k8s networking challenges. We will also show the integration of our solution in Contiv-VPP. This solution is the result of combined effort between Bell Canada, Cisco and Pantheon.tech.</p>

SUMMARY:Leveraging Open Source Designs
DESCRIPTION: <p>Incorporating new components into PCBs is a difficult task that often requires reading multiple datasheets and creating prototypes to get it right. The funny thing is: every engineer needs to re-read reference designs! Even though there are tens of thousands of designs with new components documented and available on Github. The reason: it is almost impossible to find a relevant project. The solution? Instead of using Github search, which only retrieves files by filename, our approach creates a local database that takes the search results from Github, and then parses the used components inside the PCB designs to index them. That way, you can easily search a component and get the most relevant designs as a reference.</p><p>This talk will give an overview of the software that was created, discusses the difficulties that were overcome and the potential for improvement in future work.</p><p>We have currently indexed 8,000 KiCad-projects on GitHub containing 37,000 electronic components as a proof-of-concept. The project was kindly supported by AISLER with a server instance for a prototype of the search engine, which can be accessed at https://search-dev.aisler.net</p>

SUMMARY:Port luajit to RISC-V
DESCRIPTION: <p>There is a need for a lightweight tools for experiments with RISC-Vcustom extensions. Adding support for custom instructions inbinutils/gcc/llvm is out of range for many hardware architects. LuaJITincludes a small and powerful assembler: dynasm, accessible fromwithin Lua interpreter. Currently dynasm supports following 32 and 64-bitinstruction sets: x86, x64, ARM, PowerPC, and MIPS, and it is justreasonable to extend this support to RISC-V.</p><p>Lua itself is a very compact and simple yet powerful dynamic language,its JIT compiler (luajit) makes it one of the fastest, if not thefastest, interpreted language, and it is used in many projects, sohaving it running on RISC-V would have use besides the mere internalneed for experimental platform.</p>

SUMMARY:actinia: geoprocessing in the cloud
DESCRIPTION: <p>With a rapidly increasing wealth of Earth Observation (EO) and geodata, the demand for scalable geoprocessing solutions is growing as well. Following the paradigm of bringing the algorithms to the data, we developed the cloud based geoprocessing platform actinia (<a href="https://actinia.mundialis.de">https://actinia.mundialis.de</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mundialis/actinia_core">https://github.com/mundialis/actinia_core</a>). This free and open source solution is able to ingest and analyse large volumes of data in parallel. actinia provides a HTTP REST API around GRASS GIS functionality, extended by ESA SNAP and user scripts written in Python. Core functionality includes the processing of raster and vector data as well as time series of satellite images. The backend is connected to the full Landsat and Copernicus Sentinel archives. actinia is an OSGeo Community Project since 2019 and a backend of the <a href="https://openeo.org">openEO.org</a> API (EU H2020 project).</p>

SUMMARY:Shrivelling world
DESCRIPTION: <p>Representing geographical time-space is a fundamental issue in geography, addressing core questions of the discipline, i.e. where are places and what distance separate them. Yet, considering the properties of geographical time space shaped by transport means, no satisfying cartographic representation – including classical maps and plastic space approaches –  has been proposed so far.The "shriveling_world" project aims at producing images of the global geographical time-space, using the third dimension, as in time-space relief maps. The word "shriveling" was introduced by Waldo Tobler in his comments of Mathis-L'Hostis time-space relief image, in order to describe the complex contraction process suggested by the model.The FOSDEM presentation aims at opening the code to the scientific community, now that the application is close to a first functional version.</p>

SUMMARY:Fritzing - the past, the present and the future
DESCRIPTION: <p>Making electronics accessible to the broad public was mainly made possible by Arduino, Raspberry PI and last but not least Fritzing. Back in 2009, it was a pain to get from a loose wiring on a breadboard to a PCB. Fritzing came up first with a unique breadboard view and a simple to use PCB layout. Fast forward 10 years to Fosdem 2019, Fritzing was in a major crisis. Despite well over 200.000 users, thousands of downloads per day and an enthusiastic community, development had stalled. It has now been rebooted, and the project is back to gaining momentum. So what has happened between last year and this year?This talk will give a rough introduction to Fritzing and its ecosystem, including how we overcame the problems, learned from our mistakes and how we plan to keep improving Fritzing in the future.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>OpenTAP is a project aimed at automation in the test and measurement space. It is designed for test and measurement of hardware in R&amp;D and manufacturing, but is moving more towards software testing e.g. with usage in cloud infrastructure testing. The project started as an internal product by Keysight Technologies and is used as the core of many products and solutions deployed around the world. As of 2019, we have released OpenTAP under the Mozilla Public License v2 and are working on building a community around it. The release was influenced by the team attending FOSDEM over the last few years, we will also welcome you for more detailed discussion at our booth on Saturday.</p><p>What we want is to grow an environment for people to share, leverage and co-develop test system plugins and solutions.</p><p>In this short talk, we will explain the basic concepts of OpenTAP, what it can be used for, and how to get started.</p>

SUMMARY:Uplift your Linux systems programming skills with systemd and D-Bus
DESCRIPTION: <p>Systemd is a de-facto standard process manager in all mainstream Linux distributions for almost a decade.D-Bus is most widely used inter-process communication on a local host. It's used in many core apps on Linux Desktop.</p><p>Yet both systemd and D-Bus are undervalued.Very often, programs that are only intended to run on Linux attempt to re-implement (with bugs) what systemd and D-Bus already provide(for example: watchdog function, reliable process termination, notifying another program about some event, coordination between multiple processes).</p><p>The goal of this talk is to shift perspective on systemd and D-Bus (using concrete practical examples in Go),and show how basic building block these systems provide can be re-used in software you write for modern Linux system.</p>

SUMMARY:A 'Thin Arbiter' for glusterfs replication 
DESCRIPTION: <p>Maintaining consistency in replication is a challenging problem involving locking of nodes, quorum checks and reconciliation of state, all of which impact performance of the I/O path if not done right. In a distributed system, a minimum of 3 nodes storing metadata is an imperative to achieve consensus and prevent the dreaded split-brain state. Gluster has had solutions like the trusted 3-way replication or the ' 2 replica + 1 arbiter' configuration to achieve this.</p><p>The latest in the series is a 'Thin Arbiter (TA)' which is more minimalist the existing '1 arbiter', targeted at container platforms and stretch cluster deployments. A TA node can be deployed outside a gluster cluster and can be shared with multiple gluster volumes. It requires zilch storage space and does not affect I/O path latencies in the happy case. This talk describes the design, working and deployment of TA and the potential gotchas one needs to be aware of while choosing this solution.</p><p>The intended audience is sysadmins/dev-ops personnel who might want to try out the thin-arbiter volume and troubleshoot any operational issues that may arise.</p>

SUMMARY:Asyncio: understanding async and await in Python
DESCRIPTION: <p>Often when asyncio is discussed, people think of it as a high performance concurrency programming paradigm for Python. In this talk however, we approach asyncio from a different angle, one that will possibly help some of you to finally get what asyncio is about. it's not only about performance, but at least as much about correctness and readability of concurrent applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Crowdfunding to advance open document editors
DESCRIPTION: <p>Productivity software like LibreOffice has long been sustained by the commercial activities of community members as well as the contributions of countless volunteers. That's also driven standards engagement, like the work around Open Document Format (ODF). But the cloud is slowly strangling the desktop support business, and spare-time volunteers may not be enough for complex, mature software. The Document Foundation has been innovating to sustain LibreOffice and ODF; this talk will describe the COSM and TDC projects, and ask whether similar approaches might sustain other open source desktop software.</p>

SUMMARY:Empowering social scientists with web mining tools
DESCRIPTION: <p>Web mining, as represented mostly by the scraping &amp; crawling practices, is not a straightforward task and requires a variety of skills related to web technologies.However, web mining can be incredibly useful to social sciences since it enables researchers to tap into a formidable source of information about society.</p><p>But researchers may not have the possibility to invest copious amount of times into learning web technologies in and out. They usually rely on engineers to collect data from the web.The object of this talk is to explain how Sciences Po's <a href="https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en">médialab</a> designed &amp; developed tools to empower researchers and enable them to perform web mining tasks to answer their research questions. Here is an example of issues we will tackle during this talk:</p><ul><li>How a social sciences laboratory life can be a very fruitful context for tool R&amp;D regarding webmining</li><li>How to create performant &amp; effective webmining tools that anyone can use (multithreading, parallelism, JS execution, complex spiders etc.)</li><li>How to re-localize data collection: researchers should be able to conduct their own collections without being dependent on external servers or resources</li><li>How to teach researchers the necessary skills: HTML, the DOM, CSS selection etc.</li></ul><p>Examples will be taken mainly from the <a href="https://github.com/medialab/minet">minet</a> CLI tool and the <a href="https://medialab.github.io/artoo/">artoo.js</a> bookmarklet.</p><h2>Speaker</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/Yomguithereal">Guillaume Plique</a> is a research engineer working for SciencesPo's <a href="https://medialab.sciencespo.fr/en">médialab</a>. He assists social sciences researchers daily with their methods and maintain a variety of FOSS tools geared toward the social sciences community and also developers.</p>

SUMMARY:Secure logging with syslog-ng
DESCRIPTION: <p>The design, implementation, and configuration of the secure logging service. Its aim is to provide tamper evident logging, i.e., to adequately protect log records of an information system against tampering and to provide a sensor indicating attack attempts. The secure logging service achieves this by authentically encrypting each log record with an individual cryptographic key used only once and protects integrity of the whole log archive by a cipher{based message authenticationcode. Each attempt to tamper with either an individual log record or the log archive itself will be immediately detected during log archive verification. Therefore, an attacker can no longer tamper with log records without being detected which greatly enhances the use of log archives in forensic investigations.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Source separation, stem separation, de-mixing are all different ways of referring to the same problem of recovering the mono-instruments tracks that were mixed together to produce a music file. Recently, the research team at Deezer released a free and open source software as well as trained models to perform multi-source separation of music, with state-of-the-art accuracy.In this presentation we come back on our journey to open sourcing the Spleeter library, from doing the ground research, training the models, to releasing them. We put emphasis on the technological challenges that had to be solved as well as the practical and legal considerations that came into play.</p>

SUMMARY:NOVA Microhypervisor on ARMv8-A
DESCRIPTION: <p>NOVA is a modern open-source microhypervisor that can host unmodified guest operating systems next to critical host applications. Although originally developed for the x86 virtualization extensions of Intel and AMD, the internals of the microhypervisor and its external API were designed with flexibility in mind, such that the code could also be ported to other architectures.</p><p>In this talk we present the first ever version of NOVA on ARMv8-A.  We will show how the NOVA abstractions map onto the ARM architecture, how modern virtualization features such as GIC and SMMU are being used, discuss the ongoing evolution of the NOVA API and how the ARM port differs from the earlier x86 version.</p><p>The talk will conclude with a short demo, an outlook into the NOVA roadmap and the formal verification efforts around the code base, as well as opportunities for collaboration with the NOVA community.</p>

In this talk we will show of the work we've been doing over the last year to shift Matrix from being a decentralised-server architecture to a fully decentralised-client p2p architecture, through running clientside homeservers and experimenting with libp2p and friends as a p2p transport.  We'll also show the route we'll be following over the year to go from proof-of-concept to the live Matrix network.</p>

SUMMARY:Multiplatform Kotlin Library Development
DESCRIPTION: <p>Multiplatform Kotlin facilitates code-sharing by making platform-agnostic portions of the standard library available in common code that is written once but can run on any target. As Multiplatform development really starts to take off over the next year, there must also be a robust ecosystem of third party libraries available to application developers.</p><p>I’ll talk through what it looks like to create such a library, with lessons from my experiences building one of the early libraries in the mobile Multiplatform space. We'll talk about how to find shared abstractions around different platform APIs, how to handle the fast-paced evolution of this environment, and what this all felt like as a first-time library developer. When we're done, you’ll be ready to leverage the growing ecosystem as well as make your own contributions.</p>

SUMMARY:Running full Linux systems in containers, at scale
DESCRIPTION: <p>LXD is a system container manager, its goal is to safely run full Linux systems at very high density and low overhead.Containers may be created from pre-made images, covering most Linux distributions, or by importing an existing virtual machine or physical system.</p><p>Advanced resource control and device passthrough is available to expose as much or as little system resources to those containers.Snapshot and backup tooling is available to safeguard those containers and data.Storage pools and networks can be used to offer a variety of storage and network options to the containers.</p><p>Management happens through a REST API with a default CLI client.LXD has built-in support for clustering which makes it trivial to scale a deployment to dozens of servers, all acting as one virtual LXD server.</p><p>In this presentation, we'll go over LXD's main features through a demonstration including usage of LXD's clustering abilities, running a variety of Linux distributions and converting existing systems to containers.</p>

SUMMARY:The best of both worlds?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Long has raged the war between static and dynamic typing proponents. Dynamic typing promises speedy development, less verbose code, and happier developers. Static typing promises to find bugs earlier, help you fix them when they're found, and ease refactoring. Crystal is a statically typed language, but with several novel features aimed in a different direction: the perfect compromise between the two. In this talk I will cover the history and basics of Crystal, and explore the type system which makes Crystal unique.</p>

SUMMARY:Hacking on GraalVM: A (very) Rough Guide
DESCRIPTION: <p>The GraalVM project provides, among other options, a means to deliverJava programs as compact, self-contained, fast-startup native images.GraalVM has been moving from research to development for quite a fewyears now. However, it is only just beginning to be properly integratedwith the latest OpenJDK releases and there is still much to be done toget it fully productized and to improve usability and performance.</p><p>This talk will recount our joint experiences of trying to add new and/orimproved capabilities to the the GraalVM code base. Our story willstumble gracelessly from one pitfall to the next cock-up in the hopethat by exposing and explaining our own history of lamentable error andoccasional failure you will be able to avoid being doomed to repeat it.</p><p>We will provide a guide to getting started and building GraalVM, anoverview of the how the compiler, native image generator and otherelements of the GraalVM toolkit operate plus a map of what code sitswhere in the source tree and how it fits together and offer tips fordebugging the Graal compiler and native image generator -- all the tasksyou will need to perform in order to attain a vantage point from whichto change or add to the current functionality.</p>

SUMMARY:From a Pipeline to a Government Cloud
DESCRIPTION: <p>Since 2016, the UK Government has been running an open-source, cross-government Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) to make it easier and cheaper to build government services. The GOV.UK PaaS is built on BOSH and Cloud Foundry, and is deployed using Concourse.</p><p>Concourse is "an open-source continuous thing-doer", with abstractions that help build pipelines quickly, and for extending the behaviour of the system.</p><p>This presentation will provide an introduction to Concourse, and then describe how the GOV.UK PaaS team use Concourse to continuously deploy a whole PaaS whilst ensuring high-availability and minimal impact to services and users.</p>

SUMMARY:Generation gaps
DESCRIPTION: <p>For as long as computers have been around, roughly every 10-15 years, the whole industry underwent a reset and reinvented itself anew… until the early 1990s, when somehow, the industry skipped a generation. Instead, it looked backwards, and adopted an older model of computing. The cost has been very high and is holding back the development of the entire field.</p>

SUMMARY:Back to the Linux Framebuffer!
DESCRIPTION: <p>Although KMS/DRM can replace the Linux Framebuffer, there are a number of programs and libraries that can be built on top of the Linux Framebuffer (without X11 or Wayland dependencies) and that might still be worth considering. The Linux Framebuffer allows direct access to pixels: we will illustrate it with various rendering tools (Fbpad, Fbi, NetSurf, MPlayer, ...), but also with drawing libraries such as Cairo or Evas, and multimedia frameworks like FFmpeg or GStreamer.The Mesa 3D project makes OpenGL rendering possible using only the Linux Framebuffer with GLFBDev or EGL: mesa-demos and yagears programs will be shown.We will then cover graphics libraries (GLUT, SDL, EFL, GTK, Qt) that allow to integrate high level applications running directly on top of the Linux Framebuffer with no compositor. An example will be described using either WebKitGTK or QtWebKit for the rendering of a HTML5 media player and a WebGL sample, using the Linux Framebuffer port of those libraries and toolkits.This talk is inspired by the HiGFXback project which aims at preserving historical backends used for graphics on GNU/Linux systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Fixing the Kubernetes clusterfuck
DESCRIPTION: <p>Kubernetes is complex, and extremely vulnerable. In 2019 we explored the complexity of the Kubernetes codebase, and the antipatterns therein. This year we want to look at understanding how we observe our cluster at runtime. Let's live code some C and C++ and explore the libraries that bring Wireshark, Falco, and Sysdig to life. We concretely demonstrate how we are able to audit a Kubernetes system, by taking advantage of auditing the kernel's syscall information while enriching this data with meta information from Kubernetes.</p>

Aside from the platform setup code, we need to add and maintain some device drivers to both Linux and the bootloader. We decided to avoid the extra effort and get rid of the dedicated bootloader. With a few dozen lines of assembly code, Linux Kernel and a pinch of userland tools the "boot" kernel was running with all the cool features we wanted! Then we used kexec(2) to start a "full" Linux kernel.</p>

SUMMARY:WolfBoot
DESCRIPTION: <p>Firmware updates in IoT pose a new set of security risks. Secure bootloaders can be handy to deploy new versions of the firmware on those devices that are only reachable through a remote connection.</p><p>wolfBoot is a portable, GPL, OS-agnostic, secure bootloader solution for 32-bit microcontrollers, relying on wolfCrypt for firmware authentication, providing secure firmware update mechanisms.</p><p>Due to the minimalist design of the bootloader and the tiny HAL API, wolfBoot is completely independent from any OS or bare-metal application, and can be easily ported and integrated in existing embedded software projects to provide a secure firmware update mechanism.</p><p>This presentation will focus on the implementation details and the design choices of the project, and the porting done to ARM Cortex-M and RISCV32 microcontrollers.</p>

SUMMARY:A best practices guide for FLOSS community managers
DESCRIPTION: <p>tl;dr - contribute to a community management guide written for practitioners, by practitioners; bring your internet-enabled device.</p><p>Whether you are a community manager or any other contributor to a free/libre open source software (FLOSS) project, you'll find yourself learning and thinking of good methods and practices for having a happy, successful, and productive project. Community managers and members share these practices with each other all the time -- in talks, in person, as blog posts, and sometimes as a stand-alone book. But has anyone ever really collaborated on a guide that is for practitioners and collaboratively written BY practitioners?</p><p>Actually, yes: 10 years ago The Open Source Way 1.0 was written and released. In the passage of that decade, the best practices around caring for FLOSS projects have evolved, as has the work of the people in those community shepherding roles.</p><p>We have embarked on a revamp to this guide, and we invite you to comelearn about, participate in, and contribute to this living document real-time during this  BOF.</p><p>We will begin the BOF with a brief introduction to the guide itself, what is covered within it currently, and an overview of the narrative being told from/to community management practitioners. We'll then get hands-on with the contribution process, starting with a walk through for what is needed for the 2.0 release. After we do some real-time submissions to the guide, the BOF participants can begin working together in small groups or individually on portions of the guide, including both content and publication toolchain.</p>

SUMMARY:Build for your microarchitecture: experiences with Spack and archspec
DESCRIPTION: <p>In HPC, software is typically distributed as source code, so that users can build optimized software that takes advantage of specific microarchitectures and other hardware.  While this approach provides a lot of flexibility, building software from source remains a huge barrier for users accustomed to simple, fast binary package mangers.  Most package managers and container registries label binaries with a high-level architecture family name, e.g., x86_64 or ppc64le, but there is no standard way to label binaries for specific microarchitectures (haswell, skylake, power9, zen2, etc.).</p><p>We’ll present a new project called “archspec” that aims to bridge this gap.  Archspec provides a standard set of human-understandable labels for many popular microarchitectures.  It models compatibility relationships between microarchitectures, and it aggregates information on ISA extensions, compiler support, and compiler flags needed to optimize these machines.  Finally, it provides a standard set of names for both microarchitectures and ISA features.  These features allow container tools and package managers to detect, build, and use optimized binaries.</p><p>Archspec grew out of the Spack package manager, but it is intended for widespread use by other build, packaging, and containerization tools.  We will describe how it has been used in practice so far, how it has simplified writing generic packages, and our plans to get contributions from vendors and the broader community.</p>

The developers behind Boomerang take pride in building a reliable and performant third-party library that everyone can use without being concerned about its measurements affecting their site.  We recently performed and shared an audit of Boomerang's performance, to help communicate its "cost of doing business", and in doing so we found several areas of code that we wanted to improve. We'll discuss how we performed the audit, some of the improvements we've made, how we're testing and validating our changes, and the real-time telemetry we capture for our library to ensure we're having as little of an impact as possible on the sites we're included on.</p>

SUMMARY:Task Scheduling of Software-Defined Radio Kernels in Heterogeneous Chips: Opportunities and Challenges
DESCRIPTION: <p>Title: Task Scheduling of Software-Defined Radio Kernels in Heterogeneous Chips: Opportunities and Challenges</p><p>Speaker: Augusto Vega, IBM Research (NY, USA)</p><p>Abstract:The proliferation of 'heterogeneous' chip multiprocessors in recent years has reached unprecedented levels, especially in the context of IoT and distributed edge computing (e.g. connected and autonomous vehicles). By combining the right set of hardware resources (cores, accelerators, chip interconnects and memory technology) along with an adequate software stack (operating system and programming interface), heterogeneous chips have become an effective high-performance and low-power computing alternative.</p><p>However, heterogeneous architectures come with new challenges. Fundamentally, the complexity derived from the design's heterogeneous nature challenges the effective scheduling of tasks (processes), a scenario that becomes even more critical when real-time execution deadlines must be met. This is particularly important in the context of GNU Radio, given that its underlying scheduler is completely unaware of chip heterogeneity today. Early stage prototyping and evaluation of GNU Radio scheduling policies in heterogeneous platforms becomes a valuable asset in the design process of a future GNU Radio scheduler.</p><p>In this talk, we present a new open-source simulator for fast prototyping of task scheduling policies, called STOMP (Scheduling Techniques Optimization in heterogeneous Multi-Processors) [1]. It is written in Python and implemented as a queue-based discrete-event simulator with a convenient interface that allows users and researchers to "plug in" new scheduling policies in a simple manner. We also present a systematic approach to task scheduling in heterogeneous platforms through the evaluation of a set of progressively more "intelligent" scheduling policies using STOMP. We rely on synthetic kernels representative of a GNU Radio application [2], including functions like Viterbi decoding and fast Fourier transform (FFT) that have to be scheduled across general-purpose cores, GPUs or hardware accelerators to meet the application's real-time deadlines. We will show results indicating that relatively simple scheduling policies can satisfy real-time requirements when they are properly designed to take advantage of the heterogeneous nature of the underlying chip multiprocessor.</p><p>[1] STOMP.

SUMMARY:One test output format to unite them all
DESCRIPTION: <p>Since several years, software quality tools have evolved, CI systems are more and more scalable, there are more testing libraries than ever and they are more mature than ever and we have seen the rise of new tools to improve the quality of code we craft.</p><p>Unfortunately, most of our CI system still launch a script and check the return code, most of the testing libraries don't allow to select finely which tests to launch and most of CI advanced innovations, parallel running, and remote execution, are not available to developers on their workstation.</p><p>Each language community has its own set of tools, libraries, and command-line and visual interfaces increasing the effort for developers to learn or learn again how to write, run and debug tests in each language.</p><p>How to improve the situation? In this talk, I will present one of my project LITF (https://github.com/Lothiraldan/litf) a new protocol for test running and test output as well as BALTO (https://github.com/lothiraldan/balto), a test orchestrator using this new format. Thanks to this new format, BALTO can execute several test suites in different languages, remotely on a Kubernetes cluster and all in parallel. In any case, this is the goal of the stable version.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT From Swagger to Kotlin via Gradle
DESCRIPTION: <p>When writing networking code, you want to make sure the code between the client and server implementation is consistent. After spending hours defining the APIs with your backend engineers, you’ll probably need to spend even more time implementing those details over to your code (and guess what… your backend engineers will be doing the same!). This process is boring, time consuming, and prone to errors.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be cool if this process were automated? If you could have classes and interfaces that mirror your API definition?

SUMMARY:Rewinding time with System Versioned Tables
DESCRIPTION: <p>Imagine, you're given a time machine. A fairly limited one, it cannot transport you anywhere. Still, it can show you the past, what your tables looked like at any given point in time. This is exactly what the SQL:2011 standard and MariaDB 10.3+ are giving you. System versioned tables allow you to rewind time and see their content as it was in the past — all using normal SELECT statements. This talk will show how to create system versioned tables, how to use them and how not to kill the performance when doing that. It will present various new applications and use cases that became possible now. Having a time machine, what will you use it for?</p>

SUMMARY:Engaging Enterprise consumers of OSS
DESCRIPTION: <p>It is no secret that open source software is a foundational element to many enterprise IT and software development strategies and it's also not a secret that the rate of participation, contribution, or support amongst many enterprise companies lags significantly behind the adoption rate. Higher rates of participation are seen in software-based or forwarded companies founded in the past decade, but older companies have been slow to adapt. The solution to participation is often seen as a cultural shift, but this only accounts for a portion of the lack of participation. Motiviation and incentive structures, legal structures, and project governance and management structual alignments can have a bigger impact on enterprise participation in open source projects. In this talk I'd like to discuss a mixture of academic research and my personal real-world experience in bridging the gap between enterprise development and open source projects.</p>

SUMMARY:Optimizing sandbox creation with a FUSE file system
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Bazel build system sandboxes each action (e.g. each compiler invocation) to ensure the action only has access to declared inputs and that the action only generates the promised outputs. This ensures that the execution of each build tool is deterministic and not subject to system-wide state. Unfortunately, creating these sandboxes is costly, and every millisecond added to the runtime of each action has a large impact on total build time. Just consider that Bazel focuses on large-ish builds with thousands of actions in them: each little inefficiency quickly multiplies and can result in significant slowdowns, and developers always want faster build times. In this talk, I'll explain how Bazel implements sandboxing and I will cover a FUSE file system I've been developing, sandboxfs, to optimize this process. I'll go into the details of the file system, explain how it started as a Go project and was then rewritten in Rust, and then show some performance metrics.</p>

SUMMARY:The elfutils debuginfod server
DESCRIPTION: <p>Debugging data is a necessary evil. It is necessary for running debuggers in situ, some tracing tools, or for coredump analysis. It is evil because it is big - potentially many times the size of the binaries. Therefore, software distributions have conflicting needs to generate &amp; keep this data but not burden everyone with its storage.</p><p>We will review some degrees of freedom for debugging data distribution, across compiled languages and OS distributions, identifying some of the best practices. We will identify the remaining shortcomings that necessitate exploring yet another way of making debuginfo data available needed.</p><p>We will present the elfutils debuginfo-server, where a web service offers a lightweight, build-id-indexed lookup of debuginfo-related data on demand. This service is designed to run on a nearby host, private or shared within teams, or even by OS distributions. Clients built into various debugging type tools will be demonstrated.</p>

SUMMARY:Reducing OpenJDK Java Garbage Collection times with stack allocation
DESCRIPTION: <p>In this talk we'll explore ways that the JVM can reduce the object allocation rate of Java programs automatically by performing stack allocation of objects that are known to be local to a method, or in compiler terms non-escaping. The discussion is focused on employing the escape analysis optimization in the OpenJDK Hotspot C2 compiler to determine which Java objects can be stack allocated, and how this optimization can reduce pressure on the Java JVM garbage collectors.</p><p>We'll show some results on how various real world applications can benefit from such optimizations and describe the methodology of how we prototyped this in OpenJDK. Our work is only in prototype state at this moment and we are looking for more data to understand how broadly applicable this optimizations is. This work wouldn't be possible without free open source access to Java.</p>

SUMMARY:Creating GPX tracks from cycle routes in OpenStreetMap
DESCRIPTION: <p>Across Europe, there are many regional, national and international cycle routes; they provide safe ways for families and friends to travel and explore by bike. They can however, be hard to follow: overgrown vegetation can hide directions, signs are subject to vandalism and sometimes it is just easy to miss a turn.</p><p>Having freely available GPX tracks for cycle routes means people can better plan their journey and avoid wrong turns when following the route. OpenStreetMap is the best source of information for cycle routes and these relations can easily be downloaded using the OverpassAPI.</p><p>In this talk I will present an Open Source tool to download GPX tracks of cycle routes, and a website for people to download the generated GPX files. I will discuss some of the nuances of how cycle routes are stored as relations and what processing needs to be performed in order to create a continuous route. In addition, I will speak about how the tool can be used to identify inconsistencies in OpenStreetMap data.</p>

SUMMARY:MaadiX, your cloud in your hands
DESCRIPTION: <p>Avoiding repressive surveillance, circumventing censorship and protecting privacy can become a complicated and costly challenge. Many of the available alternatives do not completely solve the problem of trust, centralization of information and dependency on whoever is offering the services to us. Initiatives that offer alternative tools often become targets of censorship and repressive surveillance. Others do not include all the services the community needs, or require a minimum of technical knowledge, forcing organizations to continue using applications offered by third parties or renounce them.</p><p>MaadiX is a solution that reverses this imbalance in favor of users, giving them back control over their communications and data, as well as over all the applications they need in order to process them, facilitating the technical adoption and maintenance of server-side, privacy-oriented, secure, and censorship circumvention technologies.</p>

SUMMARY:Design contributions to OSS: Learnings from the Open Design project at Ushahidi
DESCRIPTION: <p>Ushahidi builds OSS humanitarian tools, remotely for some of the most marginalized people across the globe. To tackle these systemic problems with how to ‘open source’ a design effort and bring the community along with the ‘on-staff’ Ushahidi designers, we’ve been piloting a series of design events on our OSS crisis communication tool TenFour with our partners Designit and Adobe. Together, we’re looking to solve the problems with how open source design can work by engaging through meaningful technology that makes a difference in the world.</p><p>We’re here to take you through that journey and what we’ve learnt about design contributions to OSS.</p>

SUMMARY:HPC on OpenStack
DESCRIPTION: <p>HPC systems have been traditionally operated as monolithic installations on bare-metal hardware primarily used by users with computational background to submit classic batch jobs. However the commoditization of compute resources and the introduction of new scientific fields such as life sciences to high performance computing has caused a shift in this paradigm. Today, an increasing number of biological software is made accessible through web portals. This improved ease of use has led towards a democratization of access to computational resourcesUsers of those fields don’t have the same computational knowledge as traditional HPC users from physics or chemistry and additionally require different kinds of workloads and applications that don’t fit traditional non-interactive batch scheduling resource management systems. Additionally, cloud computing is becoming more and more relevant and various efforts to lift HPC into the Cloud were started.</p><p>We manage the HPC infrastructure for 3 life science and 2 particle physics institutions at the Vienna Bio Center (VBC). For the new HPC system that was procured at the end of 2018, we decided to go with an on-prem cloud framework based on OpenStack to accommodate the various emerging workflows and programs. OpenStack is not a finished product and requires considerable amount of engineering. It took us around 2 years of testing and engineering to feel confident in deploying the new HPC infrastructure on top of OpenStack. Since summer 2019 we have our 200 node production SLURM cluster running on top of VMs in OpenStack.</p><p>In this talk we want to share our experiences from our endeavor into HPC on OpenStack. We want to briefly discuss the reasoning behind HPC in the cloud and specifically OpenStack.Often times these kind of projects either completely fade away in case of failure or get published in a  high-level white paper that is only useful as marketing material.We want to share our honest experience from both implementer and operator perspective. We discuss how we use 3 environments to test updates and configuration changes. We will also explain our approach to automation and infrastructure as code all the way from the underlying infrastructure to the SLURM payload and how we keep our sanity using development procedures around pull requests and code reviews. We will also share some stories from the trenches, such as why you still learn new things about OpenStack after 1000 deploys or discover that a simple config change can destroy performance.This talk will contain information that you won’t find in success stories or white papers but is hopefully very helpful or anyone who considers deploying HPC on OpenStack.</p>

SUMMARY:Discover UEFI with U-Boot
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is the default for booting most Linux and BSD distributions. But the complexity of the UEFI standard does not offer an easy entry point for new developers. The U-Boot firmware provides a lightweight UEFI implementation. Using booting from iSCSI with U-Boot and iPXE as an example let's delve into the UEFI API.</p><p>The UEFI sub-system in U-Boot has developed from barely starting GRUB to supporting complex UEFI applications like iPXE and the EFI shell and passing most of the UEFI compliance tests for the implemented protocols and services.</p><p>The session gives an overview of the boottime and runtime services of UEFI with a focus on driver binding. The challenges of integrating the UEFI subsystem with U-Boot's infrastructure are described and an outlook is provided.</p><p>Questions this talk should answer:- How does the UEFI driver model work?- How does this integrate with U-Boot?- What to expect next in U-Boot's UEFI implementation?</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>This talk will present the result of our experimentation done at i.Lab Wireless Testbed in Ghent, in the context of <a href="https://www.fed4fire.eu/">FED4Fire+ H2020 project</a>. Our project aims to collect raw radio frequency (RF) signals of widely used radio protocols for Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the 2.4GHz ISM bandwidth, such as Bluetooth Low Energy and LoRa, using software-defined radio (SDR).This will allow us collecting a large, reliable and reproducible dataset of RF fingerprint. This dataset will be further used to develop deep learning algorithms for IoT device fingerprinting and localization. Our use case is the authentication of autonomous vehicles or robots in a building according to their localization, without any over-the-air key exchange algorithm.</p>

SUMMARY:BASICODE: the 8-bit programming API that crossed the Berlin Wall
DESCRIPTION: <p>At the height of the cold war, BASIC programs exchanged by radio and cassette tape provided young people of socialist Eastern and capitalist Western Europe a rare insight into each other's worlds. BASICODE was a transmission format and an API developed by the Dutch public broadcasting service to overcome the challenge of exchanging open source hobby programs in the highly fragmented 8-bit computing landscape of the early 1980s, which was dominated by mutually incompatible versions of BASIC. Somewhat improbably, the format was picked up across the iron curtain in the German Democratic Republic, where it experienced its age of greatest popularity. The need for programs to work on platforms with widely different capabilities and incompatible syntaxes forced it to be simply structured, highly regulated and relatively well documented. This makes it ideally suited for implementation in a web browser.</p>

SUMMARY:Metrics and models for Web performance evaluation
DESCRIPTION: <p>The World Wide Web is still among the most prominent Internet applications. While the Web landscape has been in perpetual movement since the very beginning,these last few years have witnessed some noteworthy proposals such as SPDY, HTTP/2 and QUIC, which profoundly reshape the application-layer protocols family.To measure the impact of such changes,  going beyond the classic W3C notion of page load time, a number of Web  performance metrics has been proposed (such asSpeedIndex,  Above-The-Fold and variants).  At the same time, there is still a limited amount of understanding on how these metrics correlate with the userperception (e.g., such as user ratings, user-perceived page load time, etc.). In this talk, we discuss the state of the art in metrics and models for Webperformance evaluation, and their correlation with user experience through several real-world studies. Additional information, software and datasets areavailable at https://webqoe.telecom-paristech.fr</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>TLDR: Even though VM Introspection has lots of applicable areas,it has not gained it's full potential yet, due to a fragmented ecosystem.</p><p>This talk will quickly review the state of the technology and wewill present our solution: a Rust library aiming at solving the issue mentionned before,in order to make VMI a commodity in the future for apps developers, enabling them to do:</p><ul><li>Advanced Malware Analysis</li><li>Live-Memory Analysis</li><li>Complex debugging</li><li>OS Hardening</li><li>Snapshot-based fuzzing</li></ul><p>Targeting any VMI compatible hypervisor or emulator.</p><hr /><p>From stealth malware analysis to OS hardening through fuzzing, virtual machineintrospection is expanding the possibilities offered by our hypervisors,shifting our view of virtual machines, from opaques containers to fullytransparent and instrumentable systems.</p><p>Today the VMI ecosystem is made of a multitude of applications, targeting onehypervisor or emulator, with their own semantic library. (Examples includesDrakvuf, PANDA, PyREBox, icebox, etc...). If we want to make the most out of VMIin the future, we need to build the libraries that will unify this ecosystem andlet the developers focus on what matters: building quality VMI apps.</p><p>This is where libmicrovmi comes into play. It aims to solve this problem, byproviding a core, foundation library, written in Rust, to be cross-platform,hypervisor-agnostic and emulator-agnostic, on top of which higher-levellibraries and apps can rebase.</p><p>Rust makes a lot of sense for VMI for 2 main reasons:</p><ul><li>Rust is safe: considering that we are processing untrusted input from virtualmachines, we cannot allow any crash or exploitation in the introspectionagent. Also one of our use case is OS hardening, which needs an excellentlevel of trust</li><li>Rust is fast: processing an event requires to pause the VCPU. The longer thepause, the more delayed the guest execution will be, and when scaling tothousands of events per second this can dramatically influence how many breakpointsyou are willing to put, especially on production systems. Speed matters.</li></ul><p>Therefore Rust is the de facto choice for VMI apps in the future, and we arebuilding it today, by providing libmicrovmi, a new foundation for VMI.</p><p>Libmicrovmi has drivers for:</p><ul><li>Xen</li><li>KVM</li><li>Hyper-V (in progress)</li></ul>

SUMMARY:Deployment to hardware
DESCRIPTION: <p>Our project takes a fun, road-following app which leverages a basic neural network and deploys it to real hardware with an OStree update system. This has meant managing a variety of different CI-runners; GPU, aarch64 and x86_64. These have variety of different dependencies, drivers and have interfaces with a number of services and caches.</p><p>I will focus on how we constructed and developed our CI pipelines to build, test and integrate a number of disparate components to produce images and push updates into an OStree server to be deployed over the air onto our hardware.</p>

SUMMARY:Bach.java: Lightweight Java Build Tool for Modular Projects
DESCRIPTION: <p>I present "Bach.java" - a lightweight build tool for Java. Bach.java uses jshell/java to buildmodular Java projects. It supports a "zero installation" run mode, convention over configurationpragmatism, simple properties file to tweak defaults, and an API to build custom projects.</p><p>In the spirit of Rémix Forax, who wrote: "No need to be a maven to be able to use a build tool",Bach.java is targeted to coders of small to mid-size Java projects, who want to focus on theirideas and modules instead of learning and taming a build tool.</p>

SUMMARY:Using crio-lxc with Kubernetes
DESCRIPTION: <p>Running application containers within Kubernetes presents a challenge to the operator for quickly handling security updates - every container must be patched, rebuilt and re-tested, and then updated separately. The slowest dev turnaround of all your containers is the fastest you can fully update your cluster.</p><p>However, for many fixes, the application likely will not care which compatible version of a system library it is using.Using AtomFS, operators can update individual libraries inside app containers without a rebuild. Containers using an AtomFS storage backend can simply be restarted after a fix is applied, and they will see it reflected in their filesystems.</p><p>The AtomFS storage backend requires minor changes to your container runtime, and we demonstrate it with the LXC runtime and crio-lxc, an adapter to enable using LXC-based containers in Kubernetes using CRI-O.</p><p>In this talk Tycho will cover how AtomFS works, what changes are needed to make application container builds work with AtomFS, and fix an exploit live without a rebuild.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT STEP Reduce
DESCRIPTION: <p>STEP files generated by many FOSS modelling programs are much larger than those generated by the equivalent commercial software packages.  This does not meaningfully matter for most files.  However, for libraries of STEP files containing thousands of models, the extra bytes in downloads and storage can be problematic.</p><p>This talk introduces a single-purpose library and command line utility called STEPReduce that removes the superfluous elements, replacing them with their equivalent, existing in-file references.  I will show a reduction of 50% file size in both compressed and uncompressed STEP files over the full KiCad STEP library.  I will also show the resulting improvement in complex model load times using the industry standard OpenCascade import routines.  Finally, I will show the utility's verification routines of solid model equivalence between compressed and uncompressed files.</p><p>Please note that this talk replaces one entitled "News from gEDA/gaf" that was due to have been given by Roland Lutz, who has sent his apologies but is now unable to attend as he has fallen ill.  We wish him a speedy recovery.</p>

SUMMARY:Divide and map. Now.
DESCRIPTION: <p>There is a Tasking manager by the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT). We use it heavily during mapathons (mapping for developing countries). The Tasking Manager serves one primary purpose: take some great area to be mapped and split it to squares a human can map in a few minutes. With this divide and map approach, we can map a lot.</p><p>There are some issues with the Tasking Manager, however. The main problem is performance -- it is slow and failing when loaded by requests.</p><p>The next is the architecture of the Tasking Manager. It is wrong, in my opinion.</p><p>The last but not least is that the Tasking Manager is not community-driven. The Tasking Manager is a product of HOT for which you can download the source code.</p><p>In the talk, I want to introduce <strong>Divide and map. Now.</strong> -- damn project. It is an alternative to the Tasking Manager that tries to fix the issues noted above.</p>

SUMMARY:Decentralizing OAuth2.0 in a post-GDPR world for full privacy and portability
DESCRIPTION: <p>Users want their data back and the ability to transfer them the way they want to the platform they want. This si user's freedom in a digital world. Today, because of current authorization protocols/framework design like OAuth2.0, power is concentrated to the identity providers who decide what applications they allow to access their API and the user cannot say anything about it.  New regulations like GDPR have appeared to enforce this freedom for users by law but there is not yet tooling for developers to make  GDPR data ownership and  GDPR data portability happen, useful for users to avoid thisTo really decentralize data permissions from platforms control, make users in control of their privacy and make companies GDPR compliant, you need now to update OAuth2.0 dance into a stateless flow and tokenize the GDPR authorization and agreements to make it programmable for developers.In this talk, Mehdi will explain how you can use open source technologies to automate GDPR requests for your users to, build APIs on top of GDPR takeouts, export GDPR user 3rd-party data in your system and tokenize your GDPR agreements to make them programmable for compliance using opens source technologies.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Matrix is an open protocol and open network for decentralised real-time communication; shifting control over communication from the big proprietary silos back to the general population of the Internet. In 2016 we added E2E Encryption based on the Double Ratchet, and since then have been working away on getting the encryption so polished that we can transparently turn it on by default everywhere.  In this talk, we'll show how we have finally done this, what the blockers were, and then try to smash the encryption to pieces to illustrate the potential attacks and how we mitigate them.</p>

SUMMARY:openwifi
DESCRIPTION: <p>An open source "Wi-Fi chip design"(Will be AGPLv3) will be presented and a live demo will be shown in the room! The design is based on SDR (Software Defined Radio) and offers full-stack 802.11a/g/n capabilities on FPGA and ARM Linux (Xilinx Zynq SoC + AD9361 RF front-end).It conforms with Linux mac80211 framework and behaves just like COTS Wi-Fi chip under Linux. The main components of the design are: RF front-end control; PHY; low-MAC; interfacing (DMA, register) with ARM; mac80211 compliant Linux driver; high-MAC (mac80211 framework); Linux user space tools (ifconfig, iwconfig, dedicated tools via netlink).​ Since it is a SDR based "white box" design instead of commercial “black box” chip, you can do Wi-Fi research and customization without any reverse engineering efforts.</p><p>Why does it fit FOSDEM?</p><p>It will be the 1st open source project for full-stack Wi-Fi SDR implementation. Lots of people, especially wireless network/security researchers, SDR researchers and hackers, will be interested in. We are eager to show the demo in the room and hear feedback from people/community. Potential contributors are also very welcomed, and we will be glad to offer help.</p>

SUMMARY:NGI Zero: A treasure trove of tech awesome
DESCRIPTION: <p>The <a href="https://ngi.eu">Next Generation Internet</a> initiative is the first concerted effort in Europe to put significant public funding to hands-on work to really fix the internet. The long term <a href="https://ngi.eu">vision</a> of the initiative is to make the internet what we need and expected it to be in the first place: <strong>Resilient</strong>. <strong>Trustworthy</strong>. <strong>Sustainable</strong>. The concrete mission of the Next Generation Internet initiative is to "re-imagine and re-engineer the Internet for the third millennium and beyond". With new projects starting all the time, the density of awesome open source, open hardware, new science and new standards in-the-making is already intense: about 200 projects are currently on their way. These range from encrypted synchronisation for calendars and address books to symbolical protocol verification, from an open hardware RISC-V SoC to removing binary seeds from operating systems, from ethical search to the Fediverse etc.</p><p>NGI Zero offers funding to independent researchers and FOSS developers working on free and open projects in the area of privacy and trust enhancing technologies and on search, discovery and discoverability. It also offers an elaborate 'pipeline' of supporting activities that live up to high standards (sometimes called 'walk the talk') in terms of security, privacy, accessibility, open source licensing, standardisation, packaging, etc. The talk will provide an overview of the awesome R&amp;D that is now in the pipeline, how these projects are supported, and everything you need to know about the various opportunities to 'come and work for the internet'.</p>

SUMMARY:Comparing dependency management issues across packaging ecosystems
DESCRIPTION: <p>In the last couple of years, the Software Engineering Lab of the University of Mons has extensively studied different aspects of dependency management within and across different package management ecosystems, including Cargo, npm, Packagist, Rubygems, CPAN, CRAN and NuGet. These ecosystems contain a large number of package releases with many interdependencies. They face challenges related to their scale, complexity, and rate of evolution. Typical problems are backward incompatible package updates, and the increasing proportion of fragile packages due to an excessive number of transitive dependencies.</p>

SUMMARY:Fedora rawhide packages gating, for real!
DESCRIPTION: <p>Rawhide, the, rolling, development version of Fedora has often been considered has too broken and too unstable. Sometime to the detriment of the development of stable releases as well.In a near future, this should no longer be happening as now every change made to every package landing in Fedora rawhide can be gated based on test results.</p><p>This talk will walk you through the processes and changes that Fedora landed to make of this idea a reality.</p>

SUMMARY:Interactive applications on HPC systems
DESCRIPTION: <p>Exploratory data analysis has increased the demand for interactive tools. In the same way, workshops and other teaching events often benefit from immediate and on-demand access to preconfigured, interactive environments.</p><p>For low resource requirements these interactive environments can be run on workstations. However, as user count and resource demand increase, these setups become more complex. While these frameworks typically provide good support for cloud based deployments in container orchestrations, it is often preferable to deploy them on existing compute infrastructure that provides access to both software packages and the data to be analysed. The deployment on HPC batch systems specifically brings challenges on how to handle authentication, user identities, and job submissions.</p><p>The architecture of these applications can be considered as following the master -- minion paradigm in most cases. One central component manages user access and acts as a gateway. It launches one or multiple per-user instances of a compute component, that provides the actual user environment.</p><p>We want to demonstrate how we provide applications like Galaxy, Jupyterhub, and RStudio to scientists of the Vienna Biocenter. The presentation will focus on the similarities and pitfalls of these deployments. We run the web application gateway based on our standardized container environment. The compute components run as SLURM jobs on the CLIP batch environment (CBE). Specific focus will be placed on the integration of web-based Single-Sign-On, and how we address the management of user identities for starting jobs on the batch system. Sources and configuration examples on the specific setup will be provided.</p><p>After the operator’s perspective, we will pan to the end-users view. Beginners and workshop situations typically prefer a static, pre-configured setup of the user session. Contrary to that, advanced users will want to customize their execution environment as much as possible. We will explore how scientists can tailor the setup to their individual needs.</p><p>Finally, we will summarize the setups of the applications in a high-level comparison from both the operators and the end-users perspective.</p>

SUMMARY:Lexemes in Wikidata
DESCRIPTION: <p>Wikidata, Wikimedia's knowledge base, has been collecting general purpose data about the world for 7 years now. This data powers Wikipedia but also many applications outside Wikimedia, like your digital personal assistant. In recent years Wikidata's community has also started collecting lexicographical data in order to provide a large data set of machine-readable data about words in hundreds of languages. In this talk we will explore how Wikidata enables thousands of volunteers to describe their languages and make it available as a source of data for systems that do automated translation, text generation and more.</p>

SUMMARY:Reaching "EPYC" Virtualization Performance
DESCRIPTION: <p>Virtualization brings many advantages, but what about the overhead it introduces? What about performance? This talk will show how great virtualization performance can be achieved, if proper tuning is applied to all the components of the system: hypervisor, host and guests, for both Xen and KVM. As a case study, we will describe how we tuned our OS in order to be able to reach, inside VMs, close to baremetal performance, on a server powered by a CPU from the AMD EPYC 7002 (codename "Rome") series. We will, of course, show the benchmarks proving that (run on KVM), even when memory encryption is used.</p>

SUMMARY:Unikraft: A Unikernel Toolkit
DESCRIPTION: <p>Although unikernels - images containing specialized OS primitives and libraries targeting a specific application - have shown impressive performance potential (e.g., fast I/O of 40 Gbps, fast instantiation in the millisecond range, minimal memory footprints of only KBs and a minimal trusted compute base), creating them has proven to be a complicated and time-consuming process. This is mostly because operating system components have to be individually specialized and developed for each target application and target platform.</p><p>In this talk we give an update on the Unikraft open source project. Unikraft is a toolkit for creating specialized unikernels and it aims to remove the need for time-consuming, expert work. In the past two years, the community has put a lot of effort into supporting OS functionality, drivers, and platforms, porting libraries, and providing tools to ease porting of existing applications. We will give an overview of all the exciting achievements and conclude with an outlook of recent project directions: binary compatibility (Linux ABI), support for a wide range of compiled and interpreted languages (e.g., web assembly, Go, Python, Ruby, etc.), enhanced safety features, and the ability to seamlessly produce images ready to run as extremely lean VMs, containers, or directly on bare metal. The aim is that Unikraft will represent a step forward towards wider adoption of unikernels beyond the research community.</p>

SUMMARY:Building a self healing system with SaltStack
DESCRIPTION: <p>As the number of servers that we are responsible for increases, the ability to manage issues on those systems becomes more and more difficult.  Situations arise like log files filling up disks, failed login attempts that could be brute force attacks, and unwanted processes and services running.  Using the Beacon and Reactor systems of SaltStack, we can monitor a system for these have SaltStack restore those systems to the desired state.  In this talk, we’ll look at some real-life examples of these scenarios and how Saltstack can help to automatically heal the systems.</p>

SUMMARY:Heads OEM device ownership/reownership : A tamper evident approach to remote integrity attestation
DESCRIPTION: <p>Insurgo had engaged itself in the adventure of facilitating security accessibility and received NlNet funding to do exactly that. Now it wants to get developers involved and expand funding.</p><p>The goal of this is to bridge the gap between reasonably secure OS (QubesOS) and slightly more secure hardware (Heads) to help privacy-focused users and those that are vulnerable. But we need to prepare for the future now!</p><p>Insurgo has challenged the status quo that has been prevalent since 2015 and has made it possible for OEMs to preinstall QubesOS, thanks to the Heads Open Source Firmware (OSF) and his own PrivacyBeast QubesOS certified branch, not yet merged upstream, due to the lack of time and resources of a single man effort needing additional collaboration.</p><p>The integrity of the firmware and boot files is already remotely sealed and can be attested over smartphone (TPMTOTP) and from the bundled Librem Keys/Nitrokey Pro 2 (HOTP), prior to shipping. Thanks to HOTP-enabled USB security dongles bounded to shipped products, the user can visually validate that the hardware they've received is in OEM attested state, prior to complete reownership which is regenerating all required secrets from a trustable recovery environment (Heads OSF) thanks to a re-ownership wizard that guides the user until completion.</p><p>This is just the beginning of the adventure and the road ahead requires your help. Insurgo wants to propel this movement forward.</p><p>Today's secure hardware (REAL open source initialized hardware, eg. the RYF KGPE-D16, replicant supported phones, Sandy bridge/Ivy bridge based boards, eg. x230) struggle to stay current with upstream code and compliance requirements. LineageOS dropped support of the i9300. Coreboot dropped support of the KGPE-D16 platform. And the list will expand if no measures are taken to support maintainership of privacy focused projects that are taken for granted until support is finally dropped. This is a real problem requiring real solutions.</p><p>New efforts to support future, REAL Open Source Hardware (newly Respect Your Freedom [RYF] certified hardware, eg. Talos II from RaptorEngineering, future Power10 based hardware) are neither currently under active development nor currently supported by QubesOS. This needs to change. Now.</p><p>There is an opportunity for transition. This requires leadership, developers and funding.This is why we've created the Insurgo Initiative on the OpenCollective platform.</p><p>This is where transparent funding will be available to the public for open source R&amp;D. Please consider participating through code contributions!</p>

SUMMARY:Journalists are researchers like any others
DESCRIPTION: <p>We are not journalists. But we are developers working for journalists. When we receive leaks, we are flooded by the huge amount of documents and the huge amount of questions that journalists have, trying to dig into this leak. Among others :</p><pre><code>* Where to begin ?* How many documents mention "tax avoidance" ?* How many languages are in this leaks ?* How many documents are in CSV ?</code></pre><p>Journalists have more or less the same questions as researchers ! So to help them answer all these questions, we developed Datashare. In a nutshell, Datashare is a tool to answer all your questions about a corpus of documents : just like Google but without Google and without sending information to Google. That means that it extracts content and metadata from all types of documents and index it. Then, it detects any people, locations, organizations and email addresses. The web interface expose all of that to let you have a complete overview of your corpus and search through it. Plus Datashare lets you star and tag documents.</p><p>We didn't want to reinvent the wheel, and use assets that has been proved to work well. How did we end up with Datashare from an heterogeneous environment ? Initially we had :</p><pre><code>- a command line tool to extract text from huge document corpus- a proof of concept of NLP pipelines in java- a shared index based on blacklight / RoR and SolR- opensource tools and frameworks</code></pre><p>Issues we had to fix :</p><pre><code>- UX- scalability of SolR with millions of documents- integration of all the tools in one- maintainability and robustness while increasing code base</code></pre>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT Simulating noisy quantum devices with QuTiP
DESCRIPTION: <p>Simulation is a powerful tool to understand quantum phenomena. The simulation of quantum circuits is usually achieved by gate matrix product, such as in Qiskit and ProjectQ. Thanks to the Lindblad master equation solver, QuTiP is developing a simulator that simulates quantum circuits at the level of the real quantum evolution happening in your quantum device. This framework offers pulse-level control and a flexible way of noise simulation. Upon it, we are going to define different back-ends for different physics systems such as Cavity QED, Ion trap or Superconducting system. The simulator could help to improve your quantum device, study the effect of noise and create noise mitigation scheme.</p>

Based on these visualizations and reading the database source code (this is why we love Open Source!) you can quickly gain insight about what's burning CPU (FlameGraphs) and what's causing CPU to wait (ColdGraphs), and with this knowledge you will be several steps closer to answering "what's consuming all that CPU time".</p>

SUMMARY:How Does Innersource Impact on the Future of Upstream Contributions?
DESCRIPTION: <p>Innersource is a growing phenomenon that is widely viewed as improvement over existing regimes of proprietary silos within for-profit corporate walls. The bargain it strikes is compelling but curious: developers yield benefits that please them regarding software sharing &amp; improvement, while companies succeed in keeping their software crown jewels locked up &amp; locked down. How will that impact software freedom? Will it increase or decrease upstream contribution?  Will developers use Innersource as a jumping ground to FLOSS contribution, or will silos stay siloed?   What can Open Source Program Offices do to mitigate downsides to Innersource in an effort to increase FOSS-curious employee retention and interest? This talk explores these issues.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>To run our software we need a flow of data going through it. Usually we write scripting pieces to make that workflow of data moving from one component to the next. Integration Processes are the "glue" between these software pieces. Automating the data flows, adding conditional steps, handling credentials on a secure way,... That's usually a tedious and repetitive task lots of developers do again and again. With Integration Processes frameworks we can make it simpler and reuse expertise from other developers. We could even build entire workflows without throwing a single line of code.</p>

SUMMARY:Gunrock: High-Performance Graph Analytics for the GPU
DESCRIPTION: <p>Gunrock is a CUDA library for graph-processing designed specifically for the GPU. It uses a high-level, bulk-synchronous, data-centric abstraction focused on operations on vertex or edge frontiers. Gunrock achieves a balance between performance and expressiveness by coupling high-performance GPU computing primitives and optimization strategies, particularly in the area of fine-grained load balancing, with a high-level programming model that allows programmers to quickly develop new graph primitives that scale from one to many GPUs on a node with small code size and minimal GPU programming knowledge.</p><p>Features of Gunrock include:- Best of class performance among GPU graph analytics frameworks- A large number of graph applications (28 at last count)- A data-centric programming model targeted at GPUs that offers advantages over other programming models- A programming model that scales to multiple GPUs with high performance while still using the same code as a single-GPU primitive</p><p>Gunrock began in 2013 as a project under DARPA's XDATA program and is currently the performance reference in DARPA's HIVE program. Gunrock is also in development as a component in NVIDIA's RAPIDS platform for data analytics. The Gunrock team actively develops and improves Gunrock under an Apache 2.0 license.</p><p>https://gunrock.github.io/</p>

SUMMARY:Mixing kool-aids! Accelerate the internet with AF_XDP & DPDK
DESCRIPTION: <p>"With its recent advancements, AF<em>XDP is gaining popularity in the high performance packet processing space. As a result, existing frameworks for packet processing, such as DPDK, are integrating AF</em>XDP support to provide more options for moving packets to user space applications. The challenge with such integration is that both AF_XDP and frameworks like DPDK have their own assumptions and constraints about such things as, for example, how to align or manage packet buffers, making the integration less straight forward than it might appear at first glance.</p><p>This talk takes a look at the usability of AF<em>XDP pre-kernel v5.4, before diving into the recent challenges we encountered when integrating DPDK and AF</em>XDP, and how we made changes (on both sides) to allow the two to work together in a much more seamless manner."</p>

SUMMARY:Containers and Steam
DESCRIPTION: <p>The availability of namespaces inside user sessions is increasing, and Valve's Steam game distribution platform is taking advantage of this for better gaming on Linux.</p><p>A recent beta of Steam for Linux adds pressure-vessel, an experimental mechanism developed by Collabora to put games in containers. This gives the game partial isolation from various aspects of the host system, and in particular allows it to use a runtime library stack that is not entangled with the host's, with different games using different runtimes.</p><p>Meanwhile, the unofficial Steam Flatpak app distributed on Flathub puts the entire Steam client and all of its games in a container. This gives the Steam client more thorough isolation from the host system, but all the games have to share that single container.</p><p>In this talk, pressure-vessel developer and Flatpak contributor Simon McVittie will compare the two approaches and the challenges they encounter, and look at where Steam containers might go in the future.</p>

SUMMARY:Getting Your Virtual Hands On RIST
DESCRIPTION: <p>There are a number of error correction protocols that provide backwards error correction. These are commonly used to transport media streams from remotes to the content provider, or the content provider to distribution. They allow, for example, streams from a pro basketball game to be transported over public Internet from stadium to network NOC without error; or as another example, packages of ethnic TV channels, to be moved from continent to continent. Players include DVEO, which uses the proprietary Dozer protocol for which the speaker holds the patent; WOWZA uses a customized SRT which is based on open source, and a few more. They all work on the principle of shooting off a bunch of udp packets from one IP to another, setting up a buffer, and then using an automatic re-request mechanism to request re-sends of lost or corrupted udp packets. RIST was designed with the participation of several vendors to bring some of the features normally found in proprietary error correction protocols into the free and open source world. It may even become a "lingua franca" between vendors. VLC, upipe and gstreamer can already reassemble and play back RIST transported streams. We will talk about a new open source project that provides an easy to use lib for rist and we'll discuss two pre-packaged images we've made available for AWS, Azure, VMWare and KVM. With these images, you can send a RIST encoded stream from cloud to end user viewer, or from cloud to cloud.</p>

SUMMARY:Ephemeral Pinning: A Dynamic Metadata Management Strategy for CephFS
DESCRIPTION: <p>Having a separate cluster of Metadata Servers (MDS) is a well known design strategy among distributed file-system architectures.  One challenge faced by this approach is how to distribute metadata among the MDSs. Unlike data storage and it's associated I/O throughput, which can be scaled linearly with the number of storage devices, file-system metadata is a fairly complex entity to scale due to it's hierarchical nature. In hindsight, a pure hashing based metadata distribution strategy seems like a perfect fit. But, this is not exactly the case. What are the pitfalls then? Too many inter-MDS hops (due to POSIX traversal semantics), loss of hierarchical locality degrades file-system performance, and as a result, this is not beneficial for a workload whose directory hierarchy tree grows in depth rather than breadth. CephFS's metadata balancer takes a different approach by partitioning metadata sub-trees across MDSs thereby preserving good locality benefits. Although efficient, this involves a lot of back and forth migrations of sub-trees and the locality benefits are sometimes trumped by sub-optimal distributions.</p><p>In this talk, we present a new metadata distribution strategy employed in CephFS - Ephemeral Pinning. This strategy combines the benefits of hashing and naive sub-tree partitioning by intelligently pinning sub-trees to MDSs so as to obtain a balanced distribution as the workload metadata grows by depth and breadth. A consistent hashing based load balancer helps in maintaining an optimal distribution during addition or failure of MDSs.</p>

SUMMARY:Software Defined Radio based scientific instrumentation
DESCRIPTION: <p>Software Defined Radio is best known for receiving and processing radiofrequency signals transmitted over the ether. However, many scientific experiments benefit from the flexibility, stability and reconfigurability of digital signal processing even when handling radiofrequency signals. In this presentation, we address two demonstrations of this concept. First, readily available SDR hardware is used to replace general purpose laboratory instruments (spectrum analyzer, lock in amplifier)for characterizing radiofrequency processing acoustic transducers (filters, resonators). The benefit of SDR lies in communication bandwidth: while general purposeinstrument communication protocols (GPIB, VXI11 over Ethernet) require hundreds of milliseconds or seconds to transfer data, SDR platforms stream at high bandwidth I/Q coefficients collected on the fly on a ZeroMQ socket by the (GNU/Octave) processing software. We demonstrate a 10000 fold bandwidth gain when converting a general purpose instrument experiment to a SDR approach. Another approach is to address high bandwidth radiofrequency oscilloscopes as radiofrequency source for time of flight measurement. The gr-oscilloscope GNU Radio source demonstrates how to communicate between GNU Radio and laboratory grade equipment, here oscilloscopes, for processing discontinuous data streams using GNU Radio.</p>

SUMMARY:Building cloud-based data services to enable earth-science workflows across HPC centres
DESCRIPTION: <p>Weather forecasts produced by ECMWF and environment services by the Copernicus programme act as a vital input for many downstream simulations and applications. A variety of products, such as ECMWF reanalyses and archived forecasts, are additionally available to users via the MARS archive and the Copernicus data portal. Transferring, storing and locally modifying large volumes of such data prior to integration currently presents a significant challenge to users. The key aim for ECMWF within the H2020 HiDALGO project is to migrate some of these tasks to the cloud, thereby facilitating fast and seamless application integration by enabling precise and efficient data delivery to the end-user. The required cloud infrastructure development will also feed into ECMWF's contribution to the European Weather Cloud pilot which is a collaborative cloud development project between ECMWF and EUMETSAT.</p><p>ECMWF and its HiDALGO partners aim to implement a set of services that enable the simulation of complex global challenges which require massive high performance computing resources alongside state-of-the-art data analytics and visualization.</p><p>ECMWF's role in the project will be to enable seamless integration of two pilot applications with its meteorological data and services delivered via ECMWF's Cloud and orchestrated by bespoke HiDALGO workflows. The demonstrated workflows show the increased value of weather forecasts, but also derived forecasts for air quality as provided by the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS).</p><p>The HiDALGO use-case workflows are comprised of four main components: pre-processing, numerical simulation, post-processing and visualization. The core simulations are ideally suited to running in a dedicated HPC environment, due to their large computational demands, coupled with the heavy communication overhead between parallel processes. However, the pre-/post-processing and visualisation tasks generally do not demand more than a few cores to compute and do not require message passing between instances, hence they are good candidates to run in a cloud environment. Enabling, managing and orchestrating the integration of both HPC and cloud environments to improve overall performance is the key goal of HiDALGO.</p><p>This talk will give a general overview of HiDALGO project and its main aims and objectives. It will present the two test pilot applications which will be used for integration, and an overview of the general workflows and services within HiDALGO. In particular, it will focus on how ECMWF's cloud data and services will couple with the test pilot applications to improve overall workflow performance and enable access to new data for the pilot users.</p><p>This work is supported by the HiDALGO project and has been partly funded by the European Commission's ICT activity of the H2020 Programme under grant agreement number: 824115.</p>

SUMMARY:Monitoring of a Large-Scale University Network: Lessons Learned and Future Directions
DESCRIPTION: <p>The complexity of network monitoring strongly depends on the size of the network under observation. Challenges in monitoring large-scale networks arise not only from dealing with a large volume of traffic, but also from keeping track of all traffic sources, destinations, and who-talks-to-whom communications. Analyzing this information allows to uncover new behaviors that would have not been visible by merely observing common metrics such as bytes and packets. The drawback is that extra pressure is put on the monitoring system as well and on the downstream data- and timeseries-stores.</p><p>This talk presents a case study based on the monitoring of a large-scale university network. Challenges faced, findings, and lessons learned will be examined. It will be shown how to make sense of the input data to properly manage and reduce its scale as early as possible in the monitoring system. The discussion will also highlight the advantages and limitations of the opensource software components of the monitoring system. In particular, the opensource network monitoring tool ntopng and the timeseries-store InfluxDB will be considered. It will be shown what happens when ntopng and InfluxDB are pushed to their limits and beyond, and what it can be done to ensure their smooth operation. Relevant findings, behaviors uncovered in the network traffic, and future directions will conclude the talk. Intended audience is technical and managerial individuals who are familiar with network monitoring.</p>

SUMMARY:Infrastructure testing, it's a real thing!
DESCRIPTION: <p>Software developers have been testing their code for years. Why is it still not a common thing for infrastructure and operations people? We are in an era where it is expected everyone moves fast. Moving too fast can negatively affect our customers so it's vital that we ensure the changes we make to our infrastructure are tested like other code changes would be.</p><p>In this talk, Paul is going to demonstrate some of the methods for testing infrastructure code. The talk will demonstrate how to establish fast feedback loops that provisions infrastructure, as well as being able to check that the code adheres to company policies, and has not drifted from the plan of record as specified in our infrastructure as code repository.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT Transforming scattered analyses into a documented, reproducible and shareable workflow
DESCRIPTION: <p>This presentation is a feedback from experience on helping a researcher transforming a series of scattered analyses into a documented, reproducible and shareable workflow.<br/>Time allocated by researchers to program / code the analyses required to answer their scientific questions is usually low compared to other tasks. As a result, multiple small experiments are developed and outputs are gathered as best as possible to be presented in a scientific paper. However, science is not only about sharing results but also sharing methods. How can we make our results reproducible when we developed multiple, usually undocumented analyses? What do we do if the program is only applicable to our computer directory architecture? This is always possible to take time to rewrite, re-arrange and document analyses at the time we want/have to share them. Here, I will take the exemple of a "collaboration fest" where we dissected R scripts of a researcher in ecology. We started a reproducible, documented and open-source R-package along with its website, automatically built using continuous integration: <a href="https://cesco-lab.github.io/Vigie-Chiro_scripts/">https://cesco-lab.github.io/Vigie-Chiro_scripts/</a>.<br/>However, can we think, earlier in the process, a better way to use our small programming time slots by adopting a method that will save time in our future? In this aim, I will present a documentation-first method using little time while writing analyses, but saving a lot when the time has come to share your work.</p>

SUMMARY:Improving the Security of Edge Computing Services
DESCRIPTION: <p>For the last several years, hypervisors have played a key role in platformsecurity by reducing the possible attack surface. At the same time, the hypesurrounding computing and Internet of Things Gateways has led to an increase innetwork appliance devices. Our target was to create a less-insecure virtualnetwork appliance using TrenchBoot, Trusted Platform Module 2.0 and AMD SKINITDynamic Root of Trust for Measurement to establish a Xen hypervisor with ameta-virtualized pfSense firewall. We are going to present it with an updateof the status of support of TrenchBoot for AMD processors.This appliance is supported by are supported by apu2, a reliable low-SWaP x86device from Swiss OEM PC Engines. It can be used as a Single Office / HomeOffice firewall or an industrial edge device and has mostly open-sourcehardware, coreboot firmware, mPCIe extensibility and an extended supportlifecycle for the embedded Central Processing Unit and motherboard.In this talk, we will show how to create a system, which enables a significantportion of computations to the edge devices while maintaining security. Usinga simple, well-known platform, we will conduct a secure boot using the StaticRoot of Trust for Measurement with coreboot, move to the Dynamic Root of Trustfor Measurement by SKINIT in TrenchBoot and use all of this to provide acomplete chain of trust for the Xen hypervisor, a virtual firewall applianceisolated by an input–output memory management unit (IOMMU) from the physicalnetwork interface controller (NIC) devices. We will present benchmark dataon virtualization overhead, explain how this complexity can still be practicaland outline the value of this stack. In the second part of presentation we willdiscuss current status of Intel TXT development in the GRUB and Linux kernel.</p>

SUMMARY:VUOS: Give Your Processes a New VU
DESCRIPTION: <p>VUOS is a different perspective on namespaces, anykernels and related concepts. The main idea behind VUOS is that it is possible to give processes their own "view" using partial virtual machines.</p><p>A partial virtual machine intercepts the system call requests and operates like a filter: system calls can be forwarded to the kernel of the hosting system or processed by the partial virtual machine hypervisor.In this way processes can see a mix of resources provided by the kernel (on which they have the same view of the other processes) and virtual resource. It is possible to mount filesystems, load networking stacks, change the structure of the file system tree, create virtual devices.</p><p>The hypervisor is just a user process so while it gives new perspective for processes, it does not widen the attack surface of the kernel.</p>

SUMMARY:Dial your Networking Code up to 11
DESCRIPTION: <p>Modern CPUs provide a wide variety of Single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD) instructions, or vector instuctions, for operating on larger blocks of data than with regular instructions. Though thought of by many programmers primarily as instructions for doing calculations in parallel on arrays of data, these vector instructions can actually be used in other ways to accelerate packet processing applications. This talk goes through a number of examples in open-source projects, such as DPDK and OVS, where vector instructions have been used to boost performance significantly, and explains the general techniques used that can be applied to other applications.</p>

SUMMARY:Building a thriving community in company-led open source projects
DESCRIPTION: <p>Traditional open source projects involve contributors from different organizations with the goal of addressing a common challenge for participating organizations or even the entire industry. Today, there are also many companies with businesses built around open source software. At first glance, it may seem impossible to build an open and authentic community for a company-based open source project when you need to balance the needs of the company with those of the community. In this talk, you will find that there are actually a lot similarities between contributors in company-based and traditional open source projects.  Additionally, it is possible to build a thriving community by satisfying the intrinsic motivation of contributors and providing opportunities for community members to have a voice in how the community (or even the business) is run. The presenter will also discuss how they transitioned from working as a community manager in foundation-based projects to a company-based open source project.</p>

SUMMARY:Async await in Nim
DESCRIPTION: <p>The most basic API for async IO that is high level uses callbacks, but working with those becomes convoluted very quickly. A great solution is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Async/await">async await</a>, but implementing it in a language is a complex endeavour. That is unless your language is flexible enough with strong enough metaprogramming support to make it possible to implement it without modifications to the compiler. Nim is one such language and its async await implementation is entirely implemented inside the standard library. In this talk I will describe how async await in Nim works, both at the syntax level and the event loop level.</p>

SUMMARY:Hardware-Software Co-Design for Efficient Graph Application Computations on Emerging Architectures
DESCRIPTION: <p>Graph databases and applications have attracted much attention in the past few years due to the efficiency with which they can represent big data, connecting different layers of data structures and allowing analysis while preserving contextual relationships.This has resulted in a fast-growing community that has been developing various database and algorithmic innovations in this area, many of which will be gathering together in this conference. We joined this field as computer architecture researchers and are currently building a complete hardware-software design, called DECADES, that aims to accelerate the execution of these algorithms.</p><p>From a computer architecture point of view, applications involving dense matrix operations such as neural networks have garnered much attention for their acceleration through specialized hardware such as GPUs and TPUs, while graph applications remain difficult to improve even with modern specialized accelerator designs. The reason for this is the characteristic pointer-based data structures of graph applications and the resulting irregular memory accesses performed by many of these workloads. Such irregular memory accesses result in memory latency bottlenecks that dominate the total execution time. In this talk, as part of the DECADES infrastructure, we present an elegant hardware-software codesign solution, named FAST-LLAMAs, to overcome these memory-bottlenecks, and thus, accelerate graph and sparse applications in an energy efficient way.</p>

SUMMARY:Distributed HPC Applications with Unprivileged Containers
DESCRIPTION: <p>We will present the challenges in doing distributed deep learning training at scale on shared heterogeneous infrastructure. At NVIDIA, we use containers extensively in our GPU clusters for both HPC and deep learning applications. We love containers for how they simplify software packaging and enable reproducibility without sacrificing performance. Docker is a popular tool for running application containers on Linux, and while it is possible to enable container workflows for users by granting them access to the docker daemon, the security impact needs to be carefully considered, especially in a shared environment. Relying on docker for the container runtime also requires a large amount of complicated boilerplate code to start multi-node jobs using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for communication. In this presentation, we will introduce a new lightweight container runtime inspired from LXC and an associated plugin for the Slurm Workload Manager. Together, these two open-source projects enable a more secure architecture for our clusters, while also enabling a smoother user experience with containers on multi-node clusters.</p>

SUMMARY:Helpful NullPointerExceptions - The little thing that became a JEP
DESCRIPTION: <p>One of the most prevalent - if not the most prevalent - exception type in Java is the NullPointerException. While Java set out to overcome the possibilitiesto do the mistakes one can do when programming in languages like C/C++ by not exposing pointers in the Java language, the misleading term 'pointer' sneakedinto this exception. To this day, NullPointerExceptions thrown by the runtime system didn't contain messages. All you had was a callstack and a line number.But in typical expressions and statements there are several dereferences where an NPE can occur in one line.</p><p>We - some engineers in the SAP team - thought this could be helped by a little enhancement. The new NPE message gives precise information about the locationand tries to explain what was going on when a null reference was encountered. However, due to its prominent nature, it eventually became a JEP.</p><p>In my talk I'll demonstrate the improvements that come with this enhancement. I will lift the hood a little and provide a glance at its implementation details.And finally I'll say some words about the current status and share some ideas for further improvements in the area of exception messages.</p>

SUMMARY:Using SELinux with container runtimes
DESCRIPTION: <p>Lukas Vrabec built a new standalone tool, udica, for generating SELinux policy profiles for containers based on automatic inspecting these containers. We will focus on why udica is needed in the container world and how it can make SELinux and containers work better together.  We will show real examples where SELinux separation for containers had to be turned off because the generic SELinux type container_t was too tight. With a tool like “udica”, users and developers can easily customize the policy with limited SELnux policy writing skills. Come to see how easy also you can create custom SELinux policy for your containers!</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Getting your itinerary presented in a unified, well structured and always up to date fashion rather than as advertisement overloaded HTML emails or via countless vendor apps has become a standard feature of digital assistants such as the Google platform. While very useful and convenient, it comes at a heavy privacy cost. Besides sensitive information such as passport or credit card numbers, the correlation of travel data from a large pool of users exposes a lot about people's work, interests and relationships. Just not using such services is one way to escape this, or we build a privacy-respecting alternative ourselves!</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>Automatic, pattern-based code generation for Mesa's compiler infrastructure has been a long standing dream. Nearly a decade ago experiments were conducted using systems like BURS and lburg. Each of these attempts encountered various insurmountable road blocks. In the intervening years, both software and GPU architectures have changed significantly. These changes have enabled a code-generator generator to be a reality. The design and implementation of one system will be presented. In addition to the successes, various difficulties and rough edges will be detailed.</p>

SUMMARY:Developing from the field
DESCRIPTION: <p>Software design and development within interdisciplinary research teams is a specific activity which closely associates makers and practitioners in the equipment of experimental research methods and practices. This closeness allows practitioners to tackle research endeavours’ specific requirements, such as understanding the methodological assumptions encoded within the tools. It also induces a specific relationship between “makers” and their publics of “users” : a non-commercial, situated and case-based crafting process, implying shifting roles and complex decision making. How does this peculiar context affect the design and valorization practices around open research tools and their evolution ? What are the benefits and difficulties of such settings, in terms of work organization, pedagogical approaches, and scientific methodology ? What can be shared for other contexts such as activism or journalism ? Grounding on the presentation of several case studies of research tools’ design and development elaborated at the médialab of Sciences Po, this talk will offer an account of how an interdisciplinary research environment affects and dialogs with established methods of design (“participative design”, “user experience research”), development (“agile methods”), and tool valorization and socialization.</p>

SUMMARY:Automating Programming and Development of Heterogeneous SoCs with LLVM Tools
DESCRIPTION: <p>Historically, programming heterogeneous systems has been quite a challenge. While programming support for basic general-purpose accelerators such as GPUs has become quite mature in many ways, general heterogeneous SoCs in particular can feature a much broader range of accelerators in their efforts to minimize power consumption while maximizing performance. Many SoCs, though, are designed with accelerators tailored for the domain -- such as signal processing --  in which they’ll be used: Domain-Specific SoCs. As SoC platforms become ever-more heterogeneous, we think that application developers shouldn’t need to waste time reading datasheets or APIs for SoC-specific kernel extensions just to take full advantage of their hardware. With this in mind, in this talk we will discuss strategies we are using to automate mapping of LLVM-compatible languages to heterogeneous platforms with no intervention (not even #pragmas) from the programmer.</p><p>To this end, we present our prototype of a software stack that seeks to address both of these needs. To meet the first need, we developed an LLVM-based hybrid compile/run-time toolchain to extract the semantic operations being performed in a given application. With these semantic operations extracted, we can link in additional libraries that enable dispatch of certain kernels (such as a Fast Fourier Transform) to accelerators on the SoC without user intervention. To evaluate the functionality of this toolchain, we developed a runtime system built on top of QEMU+Linux that includes scheduling and task dispatch capabilities targeting hypothetical SoC configurations. This enables behavioral modeling of these accelerators before silicon (or even FPGA) implementations are available.  The focus here will be on the LLVM-mapping aspects, but a brief overview of our SoC simulation environment will be presented as well.</p>

SUMMARY:Introducing AUTOREV
DESCRIPTION: <p>Modern Open Source boot firmware ships with an increasing amount of BLOBs. While it's often claimed that it eases the integration,it makes life of Open Source developers harder, as it's not documented what is done inside BLOBs and what should be done outside ofthe same.</p><p>We will show how to trace the MMIO access of BLOBs in firmware by using Open Source tools. As analysing the traces for possiblebranches and loops is hard and stressful work, we created our own framework for automatic reverse engineering.Our framework allows to capture and analyse MMIO traces, fuzz the BLOB under test and finally generates readable code in a high level language,like C, for easy analysing.</p><p>During this talk, we will discuss the legal side, the motivation behind reverse engineering, and the benefit for the Open Source community.We will explain the problems we faced, and explain the basic concept used, with examples from the real world.</p>

SUMMARY:Precise, cross-project code navigation at GitHub scale
DESCRIPTION: <p>GitHub has recently added Code Navigation features (jump to definition and find all references) that let you navigate code directly on <a href="github.com">github.com</a>. For the languages that we support, we extract and store symbol information for every named branch and tag, of every repository, public or private, with no configuration necessary. The compute and storage requirements to do this for all of the code on GitHub are quite large. In this talk, we'll discuss some of the trade-offs we've made to make this tractable at GitHub's scale, to be able to operate and monitor this service effectively, and to let us add support for new languages quickly and easily. We'll also talk about our ongoing work to extend Code Navigation to handle links that cross package and repository boundaries.</p>

SUMMARY:Programmable Unified Memory Architecture (PUMA)
DESCRIPTION: <p>Large scale graph analytics is essential to analyze relationships in big data sets. Thereto, the DARPA HIVE program targets a leap in power efficient graph analytics. In response to this program, Intel proposes the Programmable Unified Memory Architecture (PUMA). Based on graph workload analysis insights, PUMA consists of many multi-threaded cores, fine-grained memory and network accesses, a globally shared address space and powerful offload engines. In this talk, we will describe the PUMA architecture, both in terms of hardware and the software ecosystem. We will provide initial simulation based performance estimations, showing that for graph analysis applications, a PUMA node will outperform a conventional compute node by one to two orders of magnitude. Additionally, PUMA will continue to scale across multiple nodes, which is a challenge in conventional multinode setups.</p>

SUMMARY:Comparing Hash Join solution, the good, the bad and the worse.
DESCRIPTION: <p>MySQL 8.0.18 comes (finally) with a long waited and desired hash-join implementation.That was already present in other pseudo MySQL distributions like MariaDb.But, what is has-join, how it works, what problems it solves, when and how to use it.Last but not least are all the different implementations doing the same things, or are they acting and performing differently.We are going to perform a short journey in hash-join implementations and answer all these questions.</p>

SUMMARY:Testing a large testing software
DESCRIPTION: <p>LAVA is an automated validation architecture primarily aimed at testing deployments of systems based around the Linux kernel on ARM devices, specifically ARMv7 and later.LAVA is becoming the de facto standard to test software (bootloader, kernel, userspace) on development boards (rpi, juno, beagle, ...). It's used by many projects to build large testing systems like kernelci.</p><p>Testing a testing system like LAVA is sometimes a tricky task. In order to test LAVA we had to develop some specific tools (meta-lava, DummySYS, lavafed, ...) that I will present during this talk.</p>

SUMMARY:Userspace networking: beyond the kernel bypass with RDMA!
DESCRIPTION: <p>While userspace networking has demonstrated great performance benefits, it does come with greater complexity than kernel networking.</p><p>In parallel, Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) was developed as an efficient way to move data in HPC and storage clusters with great success.</p><p>Key properties of this technology are also highly desirable for userspace networking: native integration with the operating system (OS), OS bypass and a very efficient software interface.RDMA-capable network adapters are now enabling standard Ethernet networking functions through the RDMA interface, allowing userspace networking software such as <a href="https://fd.io">VPP</a> to achieve extreme performance while integrating transparently with the OS.</p><p>We'll present:</p><ul><li>the RDMA Ethernet concepts, architecture and interfaces</li><li>how VPP leverages it</li><li>the problems solved by this architecture and the usecase it enables</li></ul>

SUMMARY:Taming Metaspace: a look at the machinery, and a proposal for a better one
DESCRIPTION: <p>When examining memory footprint of a JVM process, the delta between Javaheap usage and actual working set size can be surprisingly large. The JVMuses off-heap memory for a lot of things: thread stacks, compiler arenas,code heap, byte buffers, GC control... however, one of the largestconsumers of off-heap memory can be class metadata. Class metadata arestored in Metaspace, which includes the Compressed Class Space.</p><p>The talk will explore what Metaspace actually is and what is stored there;describe the architecture of the Metaspace allocator and the CompressedClass Space; how it interacts with the GC; how it is sized. We willhighlight waste areas and demonstrate how to use jcmd to examine Metaspaceinternals.</p><p>The current implementation of the Metaspace allocator suffers from a numberof shortcomings. They can manifest in excessive waste and a certain"clinginess" - an unwillingness to let go of unused memory.</p><p>At SAP, we developed an improved version which is more frugal with memoryand provides a much improved elasticity. So the second part of this talkwill concentrate on our new implementation. We will highlight thedifferences to the old architecture, demonstrate advantages and examine howit works.</p>

SUMMARY:OpenPiton: An Open-Source Framework for EDA Tool Development
DESCRIPTION: <p>As contemporary industrial ASIC designs have reached hundreds of billions transistor count, EDA tools must have the scalability to handle such large designs. However, few open-source RTL designs reflect the scale that industrial ASICs have reached. In this talk, we will present OpenPiton, a scalable, tiled manycore design that can reach as many as 65,536 cores in a single chip, and up to 500 million cores on a multi-chip design. The modularity and scalability of the OpenPiton design can enable EDA tool developers to test their tools' functionality at contemporary scales and adapt their development for future larger designs. With its many configurability options, extensive scalability, and heterogeneity, the OpenPiton platform is well placed to supercharge open-source EDA tool development and pave the way for a completely open-source ASIC synthesis and back-end flow tested using open-source designs.</p>

SUMMARY:A community-driven approach towards open innovation for research communication
DESCRIPTION: <p>The advancement of web technologies has created an opportunity for developing tools for real-time collaborations, text-mining, interactive data visualisations, sharing reproducible compute environments, etc. These tools can change the ways researchers share, discover, consume and evaluate research and help promote open science and encourage responsible research behaviours.</p><p>Through its Innovation Initiative, eLife invests heavily in software development, new product design, collaboration and outreach so that the potential for improvements in the digital communication of new research can start to be realised. In particular, we support exclusively the development of open-source tools, with extensible capabilities, that can be used, adopted and modified by any interested party and actively engage the community of open innovators.</p><p>In this talk, we will introduce the following projects:* Reproducible Document Stack (RDS), an open-tool stack capturing code, data and compute environment in a live paper to improve research reproducibility (see demo <a href="https://elifesci.org/reproducible-example">here</a>)* Fostering collaboration and innovation through hacking: <a href="https://sprint.elifesciences.org">eLife Innovation Sprint</a></p><p>We believe that openness is crucial to the future of research, and by supporting the community and promoting open-source research software, we can help build a culture towards integral, collaborative, open and reusable research. We hope to share some of our visions and learnings, and invite feedback and contributions from the wider open-source community on the next steps forward.</p>

DESCRIPTION: <p>With Intel's Firmware Support Package (FSP) and the recent release of a<a href="https://edk2.groups.io/g/devel/message/50920">redistributable firmware binary</a>for the Management Engine, it has become possible to share full firmware imagesfor modern x86 platforms and potentially audit the binaries. Yet, reverseengineering, decompilation and disassembly are still not permitted. However,thanks to previous research, we can have a closer look at the binary data andcome to a few conclusions. This talk briefly summarizes the fundamentals ofdeveloping custom and open source firmware, followed by a quick guide throughthe process of analyzing the binaries without actually violating the terms tounderstand a few bits, and finally poses a statement on the political issuesthat researchers, repair technicians and software developers are facingnowadays, taking into account how consumers are affected and how they perceivethe situtation eventually.</p>

SUMMARY:Spack's new Concretizer
DESCRIPTION: <p>Dependency resolution is deceptively complex; simply selecting a set of compatible versions for an arbitrary network of dependencies is NP-hard.  Much effort has been spent on this problem for modern single-language ecosystems, but many of these ecosystems rely on natively compiled libraries, and dependency mangers often fail at managing the additional complexities that native libraries entail.  Further, dependency resolution has traditionally been modeled as a SAT problem, where the package manager should find <em>any</em> workable solution to satisfy package constraints.  However, <em>any</em> solution may not be good enough.  Users want the most tested, most optimized, or most secure configuration, and this is a SAT problem coupled with complex optimization.</p><p>Spack is a package/dependency manager rapidly gaining popularity in High Performance Computing (HPC) that aims to address many of the complexities of native, multi-language, cross-platform dependency management.  Spack has recently been reworked to use Answer Set Programming (ASP), a declarative logic programming paradigm that also provides sophisticated facilities for optimization.  This talk will cover how we’ve been able to model the compiler toolchain, ISA, build options, ABI, and other constraints on native libraries. We’ll also talk about how ASP has been a useful tool for finding <em>optimized</em> dependency configurations.  This work can be used to improve dependency resolvers in general — so that they can prefer more secure or tested configurations instead of simply selecting the most recent workable versions.</p>

SUMMARY:Creating Sustainable Public Sector Open Source Communities
DESCRIPTION: <p>The Open Source Observatory (OSOR) of the European Commission is an online collection that provides its community with an information observatory, community building activities, as well as assistance and support services. On behalf of OSOR, we propose to make a presentation on the currently ongoing study towards a guidelines document for creating sustainable open source communities in the public sector.In this context, OSOR is producing guidelines for creating sustainable open source communities within the public sector. The purpose of the guidelines is to act as a practical tool that can be used by public sector officials interested in establishing open source communities or by members of such communities. The production of the guidelines is a multi-step process, involving desk research, primary data collection, development of four case studies and conduction of interviews with key stakeholders.After presenting the objectives and approach to produce the guidelines, the OSOR representatives will present the preliminary findings related to the guidelines, including the key success factors associated with healthy communities. The audience will be also invited to further brainstorm in groups the key success factors of sustainable OSS communities as well as to identify the key components that our guidelines should contain.</p>

SUMMARY:EUgen: a European Project Proposal Generator
DESCRIPTION: <p>Whoever wrote a research project proposal knows how much unnerving itcan be.  The actual project description (made of work packages, tasks,deliverable items, ...) has lots of redundancies and cross-referencesthat makes its coherency as frail as a house of cards.  For example,if the duration of a task is changed most probably you'll need toupdate the effort in person-months of the task and of the includingwork package; you must update the start date of depending tasks andthe deliver date of any deliverable items; most probably also theWP efforts and length need update too; not to mention the need ofupdating all the summary tables (summary of efforts, deliverable,..) and the GANTT too.  Any small changes is likely to start a rippleof updates and the probability of forgetting something and getting anincoherent project description is large.  Given the harsh competitionin project funding, if your project is incoherent the probability ofgetting funded is nil.</p><p>One day I got sick of this state of affair and I wrote my own projectgenerator: 10k lines of Ada code that reads a non-redundant projectdescription from a simple-format text file and produces a set of filesready to be imported in the proposal, GANNT chart included.  The usercan specify dependences between different items (e.g., this deliverableis produced at the end of this task, this milestone is reached whenthis deliverable is available, this task must begin after this othertask...) and the program automatically computes all the dates.</p>

SUMMARY:MySQL 8.0: Secure your MySQL Replication Deployment
DESCRIPTION: <p>Data protection is an extensive and hot topic. Making sure thatwhoever accesses your data has identity well established and isauthorized can be a complex and hard task. Moreover, nowadaysdata tends to move around quickly between different instances of thesame service, different services and different data consumers.  Thisoften implies that data traverses different administrative domains. Itis key that MySQL handles, stores and replicates data complyingwith the security requirements that business and regulations demand.</p><p>This session showcases the new developments in MySQL 8.0 that tightenrelated replication security setups, and reduce the attack surface ofthe different replication topologies. We will talk about secureinter-server communication, encryption of replication data at restand the new features that make the replication applier run under aspecific security context. Come and learn about security relatedreplication features in MySQL 8.0.</p>

SUMMARY:The pool next to the ocean: How to bring OpenSource skills to more people
DESCRIPTION: <p>The pool next to the ocean: How to bring OpenSource skills to more people</p><p>OpenSource powers the world and is everywhere with more and more enterprises and large companies understanding the value of it and the need to be able to be a good OpenSource citizen.However, not everyone in those enterprises has the skills to participate in OpenSource communities, feels ready to contribute something or to create and run a vibrant OpenSource community. I observed that there are two distinct groups of people - one with OSS background, ability and willingness to operate in that domain and those that will likely only use OSS without any likeliness to contribute or participate.Let's change that and build a bridge between those two groups while generating value for the enterprise making it more likely to receive support for this activity.InnerSource, the application of OpenSource principles and practices within the enterprise, can be this bridge.You'll learn about creating opportunities for people who haven't been exposed to OpenSource collaboration to learn about the OpenSource ways of collaboration in a safe environment within their organization by creating shared projects internally that follow OpenSource practices and principles.You'll also learn about how organizations can profit from cross-team/silo collaboration and knowledge exchange. Also, the acquisition of very valuable skills by their employees that can facilitate the successful transition of those internal projects into OpenSource and creation of vibrant communities around them.This approach is successfully used by many enterprises, and I'm part of a community who has built and is building OpenSource-d training material for this.Attend this talk if you want to learn about how to deal with silo issues within your company, how to facilitate your companies way to transition projects to OpenSource or how to build up skills to successfully interact with OpenSource projects. Also attend if you want to hear a bit about freely available training material explaining InnerSource  concepts for people who haven't been involved in it yet.</p>

SUMMARY:HPVM: Extending LLVM For Compiling to Heterogeneous Parallel Systems
DESCRIPTION: <p>TITLE: HPVM: Extending LLVM For Compiling to Heterogeneous Parallel Systems</p><p>SPEAKER: Vikram Adve, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>We will present a detailed description of HPVM, an extension to LLVM forcompiling to heterogeneous parallel systems.  HPVM aims to make it mucheasier to develop compilers for diverse parallel hardware, and to implementparallel languages (including domain-specific languages) for such hardware.We will briefly describe at a high-level the key parallel abstraction ofhierarchical dataflow graphs used in HPVM, and then focus on on how HPVM isintegrated on top of LLVM.  A second part of the talk will briefly describehow we are extending HPVM to enable greater energy efficiency andperformance by taking advantage of <em>approximation</em> opportunities inapplication domains such as machine learning and image processing.  Toconclude, I will briefly discuss how HPVM might be added as a dialect inMLIR so that other MLIR dialects and MLIR-based compilers can use HPVM forcode generation to diverse heterogeneous hardware targets, including GPUs,FPGAs, and custom accelerators.</p>

SUMMARY:Correlation analysis in automated testing
DESCRIPTION: <p>Correlation Analysis is a statistical method that is used to discover if thereis a relationship between two variables, and how strong that relationship mightbe. A correlation coefficient is a numerical measure of such correlation.According to the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality it has a value between +1 and −1,where 1 is total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and −1is total negative linear correlation. One of the axioms of automated testing isthat tests are independent and in spite of that correlation coefficient shouldbe equal to 0. But often it isn't. In this work, we are going to presenta method of evaluation of tests suites quality based on correlation coefficientand finding their weak points. Using PC Engines open-source firmware regressiontest results, which are based on over 140 automated tests run with 2 flavors ofsoftware on 4 different platforms, we will show how its quality can be describednumerically, and how that results can be used to optimize test criteria.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT Raphtory: Streaming analysis of distributed temporal graphs
DESCRIPTION: <p>Temporal graphs capture the development of relationships within data throughout time. This model fits naturally within a streaming architecture, where new events can be inserted directly into the graph upon arrival from a data source, being compared to related entities or historical state. However, the vast majority of graph processing systems only consider traditional graph analysis on static data, with some outliers supporting batched updating and temporal analysis across graph snapshots. This talk will cover recent work defining a temporal graph model which can be updated via event streams and investigating the challenges of distribution and graph maintenance. Some notable challenges within this include partitioning a graph built from a stream, with the additional complexity of managing trade-offs between structural locality (proximity to neighbours) and temporal locality (proximity to an entities history). Synchronising graph state across the cluster and handling out-of-order updates, without a central ground truth limiting scalability. Managing memory constraints and performing analysis in parallel with ongoing update ingestion.To address these challenges, we introduce Raphtory, a system which maintains temporal graphs over a distributed set of partitions, ingesting and processing parallel updates in near real-time. Raphtory's core components consist of Graph Routers and Graph Partition Managers. Graph Routers attach to a given input stream and convert raw data into graph updates, forwarding this to the Graph Partition Manager handling the affected entity. Graph Partition Managers contain a partition of the overall graph, inserting updates into the histories of affected entities at the correct chronological position. This removes the need for centralised synchronisation, as commands may be executed in any given arrival order whilst resulting in the same history. To deal with memory constraints, Partition Managers both compress older history and set an absolute threshold for memory usage. If this threshold is met a cut-off point is established, requiring all updates prior to this time to be transferred to offline storage. Once established and ingesting the selected input, analysis on the graph is permitted via Analysis Managers. These connect to the cluster, broadcasting requests to all Partition Managers who execute the algorithm. Analysis may be completed on the live graph (most up-to-date version), any point back through its history or as a temporal query over a range of time.  Additionally, multiple Analysis Managers may operate concurrently on the graph with previously unseen algorithms compiled at run-time, thus allowing modification of ongoing analysis without re-ingesting the data.Raphtory is an ongoing project, but is open source and available for use now. Raphtory is fully containerised for ease of installation and deployment and much work has gone into making it simple for users to ingest their own data sources, create custom routers and perform their desired analysis.The proposed talk will discuss the benefits of viewing data as a temporal graph, the current version of Raphtory and how someone could get involved with the project. We shall also touch on several areas of possible expansion at the end for discussion with those interested.</p>

SUMMARY:Running a mainframe on your laptop (for fun and profit)
DESCRIPTION: <p>Yes, this talk is about running your own mainframe on your own hardware. Mainframes are old, yes, but they are still very much alive. New hardware is still being developed and there are a lot of fresh jobs in this area too. A lot of mainframes run COBOL workloads. COBOL is far from a dead language. It processes an estimated 85% of all business transactions, and 5 billion lines of new COBOL code are written every year. In this session the speaker will help you in take your first steps towards running your own mainframe. If you like then after this session you can continue to build your knowledge of mainframe systems using the links provided during the talk. Come on in and learn the basics of a completely different computer system! And it will take you less than an hour to do that!</p>

SUMMARY:Open Edge Hardware and Software for Natural Language Translation and Understanding
DESCRIPTION: <p>The last half decade has seen a major increase in the accuracy of deep learning methods for natural language translation and understanding. However many users still interact with these systems through proprietary models served on specialized cloud hardware. In this talk we discuss co-design efforts between researchers in natural language processing and computer architecture to develop an open-source software/hardware system for natural language translation and understanding across languages. With this system, users can access state-of-the-art models for translation, speech, and classification, and also run these models efficiently on edge device open-hardware designs.</p><p>Our work combines two open-source development efforts, OpenNMT and FlexNLP.  The OpenNMT project is a multi-year collaborative project for creating an ecosystem for neural machine translation and neural sequence learning. Started in December 2016 by the Harvard NLP group and SYSTRAN, the project has since been used in many research and industry applications. The project includes highly configurable model architectures and training procedures, efficient model serving capabilities for use in real world applications, and extensions to tasks such as text generation, tagging, summarization, image to text, and speech to text. FlexNLP is an open-source fully retargetable hardware accelerator targeted for natural language processing. Its hardware design is targeted to key NLP computational functions such as attention mechanisms and layer normalization that are often overlooked by today’s CNN or RNN hardware accelerators. FlexNLP’s rich instruction set architecture and microarchitecture enable a diverse set of computations and operations that are paramount for end-to-end inference on state-of-the-art attention-based NLP models. Together they provide an open pipeline for both model training and edge device deployment.</p>

SUMMARY:Capsule Update & LVFS: Improving system firmware updates
DESCRIPTION: <p>As the rich capabilities of platforms increase, so does their complexity. As hypervisors and operating systems harden their attack surfaces, malware has been moving deeper into the platform. For example, a modern laptop may have over 15 updatable firmware elements, each with low-level access to a specific hardware domain. From the early days of proprietary BIOS in the 1980’s and 1990’s, to the world of standards in the 2000’s, to the post-PC world of the last few years, the nature of firmware has changed. In order to provide security guarantees for platform firmware, the servicing model of the platform takes center stage.</p><p>This session discusses the evolution of platform servicing using examples based on device firmware, non-host/system on a chip (SOC) firmware, and implementation of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). A modern servicing model features elements for component-based update, resiliency in case unexpected conditions, a more seamless user experience, lowering the friction of update integration, and telemetry for a view into platform health and firmware inventory.</p><p>This talk will discuss current trends in standards such as UEFI and associated EDK II firmware, and how the Linux Vendor Firmware System (LVFS) used these components as part of a holistic, open source approach to seamless firmware updates.</p>

SUMMARY:The Journal of Open Source Software
DESCRIPTION: <p>Researchers rarely cite software they use as part of their research. As a result, research software and the time spent developing it have become invisible scholarly contributions. This lack of visibility reduces the incentives that are necessary to produce and share high quality software that are essential for the progress of science.  The Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS) is an open source, open access journal primarily designed to make it easier for those individuals authoring research software to gain career credit for their work by publishing short software papers. Software papers are a recognized mechanism for authors of research software to create a citable ‘entity’ which can easily be cited in journals and as such directly impact a researcher’s career via established metrics such as the h-index. JOSS is unique in that it only accepts very short (~ 1-2 pages) papers, with short summaries and links to the software repository. In that sense, the software papers are not the focus of the review. Instead, we ask reviewers to conduct a thorough review of the associated software (which must be open source) ensuring that it is well documented, straightforward to install and functions as expected. In this talk I will describe the origin and impact that JOSS has had on research open source and also touch upon issues such as sustainability and credit.</p>

SUMMARY:AMENDMENT LumoSQL - Experiments with SQLite, LMDB and more
DESCRIPTION: <p>LumoSQL is an experimental fork of SQLite, the embeddable database library founding everything from Android to iOS to Firefox. As a replacement for fopen(), SQLite is a good choice for singer-writer applications and disconnected, slow and small devices. Modern IoT and application use cases are increasingly multi-writer, fast, high-capacity and internet-connected, and LumoSQL aims to address these very different modern needs. LumoSQL initially aims to improving speed and reliability, by replacing the internal key-value store with LMDB, by updating and fixing a prototype from 2013, and allowing multiple storage backends. Next up we are designing the architecture for replacing the write-ahead log system (as used by all other open and closed source databases) with a single-level store, drawing on LMDB as an example of a single-level store in production at scale. Challenges so far involve code archeology, understanding and updating benchmarking, designing a system for keeping parity with upstream code changes, file format migration and identifying bugs in both SQLite and LMDB.</p><p>Please do join us in testing and improving at https://github.com/LumoSQL/LumoSQL .</p><p>In this talk we welcome questions and contributions. This conference has many SQLite users and developers. What do you want to see?</p>

SUMMARY:Automating schema migration flow with GitHub Actions, skeema & gh-ost
DESCRIPTION: <p>Schema migration is more than running an ALTER TABLE. It is about designing, reviewing, approving, queuing, scheduling, executing, auditing, controlling and versioning the changes.</p><p>At GitHub we run multiple migrations per day, and much of this flow used to be manual, taking a significant toll from the databases team. In this session we illustrate how we automated away migration using free and open source solutions, and based on trusted development flow.</p>

SUMMARY:Finite element modeling with the deal.II software library
DESCRIPTION: <p>The finite element method has been the method of choice to simulate the deformation of solids as well as the flow of many kinds of fluids for nearly 70 years now. In the case of solids, it provides a general framework to describe how a body reacts to external stimuli by modeling how deformation affects the internally stored energy. While most software that implements the method used to be homegrown for a particular purpose, the 2000s have seen the emergence of large and professionally developed. open source software libraries that provide a broad range of functionality that makes the implementation of such codes straightforward. I will give an overview of one of these libraries, deal.II, and how and where it is used.</p>

SUMMARY:Temporal Graph Analytics with GRADOOP
DESCRIPTION: <p>The temporal analysis of evolving graphs is an important requirement in many domains but hardly supported in current graph database and graph processing systems. We, therefore, extended the distributed graph analytics framework Gradoop for time-related graph analysis by introducing a new temporal property graph data model. Our model supports bitemporal time dimensions for vertices and edges to represent both rollback and historical information. In addition to the data model, we introduce several time-dependent operators (e.g, Snapshot, Diff and Grouping) that natively support the natural evolution of the graph. Since this is an extension of Gradoop, the temporal operators are compatible and can be combined with the already known operators to build complex analytical tasks in a declarative way. In our talk, we will give a brief overview of the Gradoop system, the temporal property graph model and how we support the time-dependent analysis of large graphs. Based on real-world use-cases, we show the expressiveness and flexibility of our temporal operators and how they can be composed to answer complex analytical questions.</p>

SUMMARY:The journey of building OpenSpeedMonitor
DESCRIPTION: <p>Keeping track caring about web performance is hard with constantly changing standards, improving browsers, frameworks and devices.It gets even harder when you develop a tool meeting these changing requirements.Eight years ago, as an IT service provider, we were faced with the task of permanently monitoring the performance of one of the largest e-commerce platforms. After the initial use of WebPagetest, we quickly needed to develop our own features.What started as minor extensions became a separate project over time.In this talk, we would like to take you on the journey we have taken developing OpenSpeedMonitor. You will hear about some unexpected challenges, what we learned the hard way and why we would have failed years ago, if we didn't decide to develop FLOSS.</p>

SUMMARY:CANCELLED A way of GPU virtualization for container
DESCRIPTION: <p>Please note that this talk has been cancelled as the speaker is unfortunately unable to attend FOSDEM.</p><p>Containers are widely used in clouds due to their lightweight and scalability. GPUs have powerful parallel processing capabilities that are adopted to accelerate the execution of applications. In a cloud environment, containers may require one or more GPUs to fulfill the resource requirement of application execution, while on the other hand exclusive GPU resource of a container usually results in underutilized resource. Therefore, how to share GPUs among containers becomes an attractive problem to cloud providers. In this presentation, we propose an approach, called vCUDA, to sharing GPU memory and computing resources among containers. vCUDA partitions physical GPUs into multiple virtual GPUs and assigns the virtual GPUs to containers as request. Elastic resource allocation and dynamic resource allocation are adopted to improve resource utilization. The experimental results show that vCUDA only causes 1.015% of overhead by average and it effectively allocates and isolates GPU resources among containers.</p>

Because all data is stored in the vector space, Weaviate is ideal for;- Semantically search through the knowledge graph.- Automatically classify entities in the graph.- Create easy to use knowledge mappings.</p><p>Because the use of formal ontologies are optional, Weaviate can be used to create a P2P knowledge network which we want to present during this conference.</p><p>This is a follow up after the initial design was shared during last year's FOSDEM.</p>
