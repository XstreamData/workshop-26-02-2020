We have responsibly disclosed our findings, leading to 5designated CVE records and numerous security patches in the vulnerableopen-source projects, including the Intel SGX-SDK, Microsoft OpenEnclave, Google Asylo, and the Rust compiler.</p><p>Please note that this talk was originally scheduled to begin at the later time of 13:00</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/tale/","SPEAKERS":"Jo Van Bulck","UID":"10293@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200201T131500","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:20.959Z"}

But unfortunately it doesn't work in this manner. There are many different books and articles about how to write good code in go, but not so many how to debug code efficiently. In my talk I'll try to cover such important topic.Go is a new programming language with best tools for development. In my talk I'll cover how to efficiently using these tools to debug your code. I’ll start from history of debuggers, later I'll show you how to debug go itself, if you need to find bug in language.

LLVM provides some extra features in the form of 'sanitizers' to help find the root cause of some extra problems, like accessing a wrong-but-still-valid memory address or unintentionally wrapping a signed integer value. This presentation will explore how to use the sanitizers to debug programs and some examples of bugs they can catch.</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/debugging_with_llvm/","SPEAKERS":["Andrzej Warzynski","Graham Hunter"],"UID":"9743@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200201T111000","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:20.029Z"}

In processing systems ranging from connected cars and autonomous vehicles, to those on-board satellites and spacecrafts, these processors are targeted to function in safety-critical systems, where Reliability, Availability and Serviceability (RAS)-based considerations are of paramount importance. Along with potential system vulnerabilities caused primarily due to random errors, these processors may also be sensitive to targeted errors, possibly from malicious entities, which raises serious concerns regarding the security and safety of the processing system. Consequently, such systems necessitate the incorporation of RAS-based considerations right from an early stage of processor design.</p><p>While the hardware and software ecosystem around RISC-V has been steadily maturing, there have, however, been limited developments in early stage reliability-aware design and verification. The Early-stage Reliability And Security Estimation for RISC-V (ERASER) tool attempts to address this shortcoming. It consists of an open source framework aimed at providing directions to incorporate such reliability and security features at an early, pre-silicon stage of design. These features may include what kind of protection to be applied and which components within the processor should they be applied to. The proposed infrastructure comprises of an open source toolchain for early stage modeling of latch vulnerability in a RISC-V core (SERMiner [1]), a tool for automated generation of stress marks that maximize the likelihood of a transient-failure induced error (Microprobe (RISC-V) [2]), and verification by means of statistical and/or targeted fault injection (Chiffre [3]). While the infrastructure is targeted towards any core that uses the RISC-V ISA, the repository provides an end-to-end flow for the Rocket core [4].</p><p>ERASER thus evaluates “RAS-readiness”, or the effectiveness of protection techniques in processor design such that processor vulnerability in terms of Failures-In-time (FIT) rate is minimized, for a specified power/performance overhead. FIT rate is defined as the number of failures in one billion hours of operation and is a standard vulnerability metric used in industry.</p><p>ERASER is an open source tool available for download at https://github.com/IBM/eraser. The tool currently supports analysis of all latches in the design across a single Rocket core and the generation of stressmarks that can be used to evaluate the vulnerability of these latches. In addition to radiation-induced soft errors, we plan to extend ERASER to also model errors due to voltage noise, thermal and aging-induced failures, both in memory and logic, and generate representative stressmarks.</p><p>ERASER is an initial effort to devise a comprehensive methodology for RAS analysis, particularly for open-source hardware, with the hope that it spurs further research and development into reliability-aware design both in industry and academia.</p><p>References:</p><ol><li><p>K.

To manage this complexity, architects, system software designers, and application developers need design and programming technologies to be flexible, accurate, efficient, and productive. Recently, our team has started to explore the mapping of GnuRadio to various heterogeneous SoCs in order to understand how programming technologies can support this goal of making this SDR framework performance portable. Using our software stack, we are porting several SDR applications to GPUs from NVIDIA, AMD, and ARM, and to NVIDIA Xavier SoCs, Qualcomm Snapdragon, and Xilinx Zynq devices. Our current approach uses a directive-based programming model and a new intelligent runtime scheduler to port and execute the workflows. We are evaluating several open programming models to enable performance portability; initially, they include directive-based compilers, OpenCL, and SYCL. All of these approaches will generate tasks that are then queued and scheduled by our open-source intelligent runtime scheduler, which is a critical component of our approach. Initial performance results appear promising; however, more automation will further broad deployment. Also, we have developed a host of tools to examine and profile SDR workflows and modules. Specifically, these analysis tools enable automated characterization of the behavioral and computational features of GNU Radio blocks and workflows. The static tools in GR-tools help developers to create ontologies and queries to classify GR modules based on custom scenarios. The dynamic toolset provides automated profiling capabilities of GR workflows and presents detailed statistics on how components in a given software defined radio application perform. GR-tools also produces a graph-based representation of the analyzed data and provides powerful visualization options to filter and display the information obtained from the static and dynamic tools. Our software is available as open-source software and will be made available to the community.</p>\r\nCLASS:PUBLIC\r\nSTATUS:CONFIRMED\r\nCATEGORIES:Free Software Radio\r\nURL:https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/fsr_striving_for_performance_portability/\r\nLOCATION:AW1.120\r\nATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;CN:\"Jeffrey Vetter\"\r\nEND:VEVENT\r\n\r","@version":"1","SUMMARY":"Striving for Performance Portability of Software Radio Software in the Era of Heterogeneous SoCs","STATUS":"CONFIRMED","METHOD":"PUBLISH","LOCATION":"AW1.120","END":"VEVENT","path":"C:/Users/nicol/Documents/elasticsearch/stack7.5/logstash-7.5.1/data/xstream/ical.ics","CATEGORIES":"Free Software Radio","DESCRIPTION":"<p>Future heterogeneous DSSoCs will be extraordinarily complex in terms of processors, memory hierarchies, and interconnection networks.

Specifically, these analysis tools enable automated characterization of the behavioral and computational features of GNU Radio blocks and workflows. The static tools in GR-tools help developers to create ontologies and queries to classify GR modules based on custom scenarios. The dynamic toolset provides automated profiling capabilities of GR workflows and presents detailed statistics on how components in a given software defined radio application perform. GR-tools also produces a graph-based representation of the analyzed data and provides powerful visualization options to filter and display the information obtained from the static and dynamic tools. Our software is available as open-source software and will be made available to the community.</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/fsr_striving_for_performance_portability/","SPEAKERS":"Jeffrey Vetter","UID":"9788@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200202T133000","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:21.030Z"}

Second, system designers need to integrate untrusted third-party components (e.g., accelerators or modems) to meet today's performance, energy, and development-time demands. And third, security vulnerabilities such as Meltdown, Spectre, and Fallout have shown that today's complex general-purpose cores should not be trusted anymore to properly enforce isolation boundaries between different software components.</p><p>In my talk, I will present a new system architecture that takes existing microkernel ideas to the \"next level\" to address the mentioned challenges. We use a hardware/operating system co-design consisting of a small and simple hardware component, called <em>trusted communication unit</em> (TCU), that we add next to each processing element (core, accelerator, modem, etc.) and an operating system, called <em>M³</em>, that takes advantage of it. The TCU provides a uniform interface for all processing elements, simplifying the management and usage of heterogeneous processing elements, and enables secure communication between arbitrary processing elements. M³ is designed as a microkernel-based system and runs its components on different processing elements with TCU-based communication channels between them.

It also offers graphical debugging and CQ stack introspection capabilitieswhich dramatically lowers the entry barrier for trying out and using CQ.</p><p>References</p><p>[1] https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery[2] https://www.freecadweb.org[3] https://github.com/tpaviot/pythonocc-core[4] https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/cadquery/","SPEAKERS":"Adam Urbanczyk","UID":"9761@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200201T124000","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:20.742Z"}

And as designers, in general, we care deeply about our methods, workflows, principles and licenses.

First - build and keep up to date topology of a cluster without explicit configuration. The task is quite intricate because:</p><ul><li>new just started nodes know nothing about others, and they should somehow discover them;</li><li>already working nodes can fail, and it should be detected so as to change a master, or evict an unrecoverable node from the cluster, or restart it.</li></ul><p>According to the protocol, cluster nodes broadcast packets and send p2p ping requests. Broadcast helps to discover new nodes, p2p pings help to detect failure of a known node.</p><p>A second task - events dissemination in a cluster. Event is a node failure; UUID change; IP address update; new node appearance - anything that affects cluster state. Sometimes users define their own event types. When a node learns about an event, it needs to disseminate the event to other nodes. SWIM protocol describes an algorithm how to detect and disseminate events, and gives the following guarantees:</p><ul><li>it takes a constant time to learn about an event on at least one node in the cluster;</li><li>it takes logarithmic from cluster size time to disseminate that event to each node of the cluster.</li></ul><p>In the talk I tell about how SWIM works, how and with which essential improvements it was implemented, how to use SWIM, and what are the practical performance results.</p><p>Implementation is a part of Tarantool DBMS.

Come and discover why this strategy is rarely recommended as we take a deep dive into PostgreSQL indexing.</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/postgresql_a_deep_dive_into_postgresql_indexing/","SPEAKERS":"Ibrar Ahmed","UID":"10745@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200202T125000","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:20.688Z"}

Early constraints such as the maximal number of instructions for programs, or the unavailability of loops, are changing. The internals are improved with support for debug information (BTF) or 32-bit instructions. And many new mechanisms are implemented, such as global data support, the “BPF trampoline”, batched map operations, dynamic linking.

The idea is based on moving the core computational logic and storage to distant locations that are closer to the entities they interact with (e.g. users or sensors). The benefits come from improving network latencies, increasing user experience with the provided service, and lowering the transfers to the central locations.

Relying on docker for the container runtime also requires a large amount of complicated boilerplate code to start multi-node jobs using the Message Passing Interface (MPI) for communication.

While programming support for basic general-purpose accelerators such as GPUs has become quite mature in many ways, general heterogeneous SoCs in particular can feature a much broader range of accelerators in their efforts to minimize power consumption while maximizing performance. Many SoCs, though, are designed with accelerators tailored for the domain -- such as signal processing --  in which they’ll be used: Domain-Specific SoCs. As SoC platforms become ever-more heterogeneous, we think that application developers shouldn’t need to waste time reading datasheets or APIs for SoC-specific kernel extensions just to take full advantage of their hardware. With this in mind, in this talk we will discuss strategies we are using to automate mapping of LLVM-compatible languages to heterogeneous platforms with no intervention (not even #pragmas) from the programmer.</p><p>To this end, we present our prototype of a software stack that seeks to address both of these needs. To meet the first need, we developed an LLVM-based hybrid compile/run-time toolchain to extract the semantic operations being performed in a given application. With these semantic operations extracted, we can link in additional libraries that enable dispatch of certain kernels (such as a Fast Fourier Transform) to accelerators on the SoC without user intervention. To evaluate the functionality of this toolchain, we developed a runtime system built on top of QEMU+Linux that includes scheduling and task dispatch capabilities targeting hypothetical SoC configurations. This enables behavioral modeling of these accelerators before silicon (or even FPGA) implementations are available.

The audience will be also invited to further brainstorm in groups the key success factors of sustainable OSS communities as well as to identify the key components that our guidelines should contain.</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/bof_public_sector/","SPEAKERS":"OSOR team","UID":"10664@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200201T190000","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:23.095Z"}

This model fits naturally within a streaming architecture, where new events can be inserted directly into the graph upon arrival from a data source, being compared to related entities or historical state. However, the vast majority of graph processing systems only consider traditional graph analysis on static data, with some outliers supporting batched updating and temporal analysis across graph snapshots. This talk will cover recent work defining a temporal graph model which can be updated via event streams and investigating the challenges of distribution and graph maintenance. Some notable challenges within this include partitioning a graph built from a stream, with the additional complexity of managing trade-offs between structural locality (proximity to neighbours) and temporal locality (proximity to an entities history). Synchronising graph state across the cluster and handling out-of-order updates, without a central ground truth limiting scalability. Managing memory constraints and performing analysis in parallel with ongoing update ingestion.To address these challenges, we introduce Raphtory, a system which maintains temporal graphs over a distributed set of partitions, ingesting and processing parallel updates in near real-time. Raphtory's core components consist of Graph Routers and Graph Partition Managers. Graph Routers attach to a given input stream and convert raw data into graph updates, forwarding this to the Graph Partition Manager handling the affected entity. Graph Partition Managers contain a partition of the overall graph, inserting updates into the histories of affected entities at the correct chronological position. This removes the need for centralised synchronisation, as commands may be executed in any given arrival order whilst resulting in the same history. To deal with memory constraints, Partition Managers both compress older history and set an absolute threshold for memory usage. If this threshold is met a cut-off point is established, requiring all updates prior to this time to be transferred to offline storage. Once established and ingesting the selected input, analysis on the graph is permitted via Analysis Managers. These connect to the cluster, broadcasting requests to all Partition Managers who execute the algorithm. Analysis may be completed on the live graph (most up-to-date version), any point back through its history or as a temporal query over a range of time.  Additionally, multiple Analysis Managers may operate concurrently on the graph with previously unseen algorithms compiled at run-time, thus allowing modification of ongoing analysis without re-ingesting the data.Raphtory is an ongoing project, but is open source and available for use now. Raphtory is fully containerised for ease of installation and deployment and much work has gone into making it simple for users to ingest their own data sources, create custom routers and perform their desired analysis.The proposed talk will discuss the benefits of viewing data as a temporal graph, the current version of Raphtory and how someone could get involved with the project. We shall also touch on several areas of possible expansion at the end for discussion with those interested.</p>\r\nCLASS:PUBLIC\r\nSTATUS:CONFIRMED\r\nCATEGORIES:Graph Systems and Algorithms\r\nURL:https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/graph_raphtory/\r\nLOCATION:AW1.121\r\nATTENDEE;ROLE=REQ-PARTICIPANT;CUTYPE=INDIVIDUAL;CN:\"Ben Steer\"\r\nEND:VEVENT\r\n\r","@version":"1","SUMMARY":"AMENDMENT Raphtory: Streaming analysis of distributed temporal graphs","STATUS":"CONFIRMED","METHOD":"PUBLISH","LOCATION":"AW1.121","END":"VEVENT","path":"C:/Users/nicol/Documents/elasticsearch/stack7.5/logstash-7.5.1/data/xstream/ical.ics","CATEGORIES":"Graph Systems and Algorithms","DESCRIPTION":"<p>Temporal graphs capture the development of relationships within data throughout time.

In this talk we discuss co-design efforts between researchers in natural language processing and computer architecture to develop an open-source software/hardware system for natural language translation and understanding across languages. With this system, users can access state-of-the-art models for translation, speech, and classification, and also run these models efficiently on edge device open-hardware designs.</p><p>Our work combines two open-source development efforts, OpenNMT and FlexNLP.  The OpenNMT project is a multi-year collaborative project for creating an ecosystem for neural machine translation and neural sequence learning. Started in December 2016 by the Harvard NLP group and SYSTRAN, the project has since been used in many research and industry applications. The project includes highly configurable model architectures and training procedures, efficient model serving capabilities for use in real world applications, and extensions to tasks such as text generation, tagging, summarization, image to text, and speech to text. FlexNLP is an open-source fully retargetable hardware accelerator targeted for natural language processing. Its hardware design is targeted to key NLP computational functions such as attention mechanisms and layer normalization that are often overlooked by today’s CNN or RNN hardware accelerators. FlexNLP’s rich instruction set architecture and microarchitecture enable a diverse set of computations and operations that are paramount for end-to-end inference on state-of-the-art attention-based NLP models.

We'll compare approaches and trade-offs.</p>","TZID":"Europe-Brussels","host":"SurF-Pagni","BEGIN":"VEVENT","URL":"https:/fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/ruby/","SPEAKERS":["Charles Nutter","Thomas Enebo"],"UID":"10719@FOSDEM20@fosdem.org","tags":["multiline"],"CLASS":"PUBLIC","DTEND":"20200201T190000","@timestamp":"2020-02-13T11:16:23.595Z"}

GPUs have powerful parallel processing capabilities that are adopted to accelerate the execution of applications. In a cloud environment, containers may require one or more GPUs to fulfill the resource requirement of application execution, while on the other hand exclusive GPU resource of a container usually results in underutilized resource. Therefore, how to share GPUs among containers becomes an attractive problem to cloud providers.

GPUs have powerful parallel processing capabilities that are adopted to accelerate the execution of applications. In a cloud environment, containers may require one or more GPUs to fulfill the resource requirement of application execution, while on the other hand exclusive GPU resource of a container usually results in underutilized resource. Therefore, how to share GPUs among containers becomes an attractive problem to cloud providers.

We discuss how we use 3 environments to test updates and configuration changes. We will also explain our approach to automation and infrastructure as code all the way from the underlying infrastructure to the SLURM payload and how we keep our sanity using development procedures around pull requests and code reviews.

These are commonly used to transport media streams from remotes to the content provider, or the content provider to distribution. They allow, for example, streams from a pro basketball game to be transported over public Internet from stadium to network NOC without error; or as another example, packages of ethnic TV channels, to be moved from continent to continent. Players include DVEO, which uses the proprietary Dozer protocol for which the speaker holds the patent; WOWZA uses a customized SRT which is based on open source, and a few more. They all work on the principle of shooting off a bunch of udp packets from one IP to another, setting up a buffer, and then using an automatic re-request mechanism to request re-sends of lost or corrupted udp packets. RIST was designed with the participation of several vendors to bring some of the features normally found in proprietary error correction protocols into the free and open source world.

These are commonly used to transport media streams from remotes to the content provider, or the content provider to distribution. They allow, for example, streams from a pro basketball game to be transported over public Internet from stadium to network NOC without error; or as another example, packages of ethnic TV channels, to be moved from continent to continent. Players include DVEO, which uses the proprietary Dozer protocol for which the speaker holds the patent; WOWZA uses a customized SRT which is based on open source, and a few more. They all work on the principle of shooting off a bunch of udp packets from one IP to another, setting up a buffer, and then using an automatic re-request mechanism to request re-sends of lost or corrupted udp packets. RIST was designed with the participation of several vendors to bring some of the features normally found in proprietary error correction protocols into the free and open source world.

Following the paradigm of bringing the algorithms to the data, we developed the cloud based geoprocessing platform actinia (<a href=\"https://actinia.mundialis.de\">https://actinia.mundialis.de</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mundialis/actinia_core\">https://github.com/mundialis/actinia_core</a>).

We also present a systematic approach to task scheduling in heterogeneous platforms through the evaluation of a set of progressively more \"intelligent\" scheduling policies using STOMP. We rely on synthetic kernels representative of a GNU Radio application [2], including functions like Viterbi decoding and fast Fourier transform (FFT) that have to be scheduled across general-purpose cores, GPUs or hardware accelerators to meet the application's real-time deadlines. We will show results indicating that relatively simple scheduling policies can satisfy real-time requirements when they are properly designed to take advantage of the heterogeneous nature of the underlying chip multiprocessor.</p><p>[1] STOMP.

It is written in Python and implemented as a queue-based discrete-event simulator with a convenient interface that allows users and researchers to \"plug in\" new scheduling policies in a simple manner. We also present a systematic approach to task scheduling in heterogeneous platforms through the evaluation of a set of progressively more \"intelligent\" scheduling policies using STOMP. We rely on synthetic kernels representative of a GNU Radio application [2], including functions like Viterbi decoding and fast Fourier transform (FFT) that have to be scheduled across general-purpose cores, GPUs or hardware accelerators to meet the application's real-time deadlines. We will show results indicating that relatively simple scheduling policies can satisfy real-time requirements when they are properly designed to take advantage of the heterogeneous nature of the underlying chip multiprocessor.</p><p>[1] STOMP.
